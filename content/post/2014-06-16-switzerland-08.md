In 2008 we decided that we should try to have a non-scouting holiday for just the two of us. Well,
we half managed it. We chose to go to Switzerland for a week, without the [Explorer's][fs] and not
as part of a Network event, but we stayed at [Kandersteg International Scout Centre][kisc] :smile:.
The main reason for this is the extortionate prices of hotels in Switzerland. Ok, they're not
extortionate, but we couldn't really afford them so we chose the cheaper option. It cost us a total
of Â£9 per person per night to stay at Kandersteg in bunkhouse accommodation. We even got our own
room because it was out of season :wink:.

The basic concept of this holiday was to actually relax and enjoy each others company and that is
exactly what we did. Each morning we got up and either had breakfast at the centre or headed out for
breakfast on the hoof, jumped on the train somewhere, explored the area and came back to the centre
after having dinner out. It isn't easy to get anywhere from Kandersteg without a rail ticket so we
were grateful that we spent the extra money on one at the airport because it turned out to be vital
to us actually seeing Switzerland for a sensible price.

During the week, we:

 - Visited the Jungfraujoch;
 - Walked on the Aletsch Glacier;
 - Watched some of the Freestyle Kayak World Cup 2008 in Thun (completely by accident :smile:);
 - Visited Interlaken, Lauterbrunnen, Spiez, Zermatt, Berne and Grindelwald;
 - Tried to see the Matterhorn, but it was completely covered in cloud;
 - Saw the North Face of the Eiger;
 - And generally had an amazing time. We will definitely be visiting again :smile:.

The whole holiday was very relaxed, even with all the travelling around the country, and I would 
definitely stay at [KISC][kisc] again.
