                            <p>Yesteday we decided it was about time George got to see a real mountain so instead of taking the easy option and going up to Mynydd Maen, we went up to Storey Arms with a view to taking a walk up to Pen-y-Fan. Obviously we were well aware of the potential difficulties of taking a 7½ week old baby up a mountain, so we dragged along a good friend of ours, Stewart Cunningham (Diary of a Scout Leader). We arrived at the Storey Arms car park at about lunch time, I strapped George to my chest and off we went. It was a much cooler day than it has been so thankfully we didn’t have…</p>

                            <p>Over the weekend we decided it was about time we had our first family day out so, after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing about where to go, we decided against the beach and headed up to the Forest of Dean to visit Puzzlewood. The place was described as a “Magical Day Out in the Forest of Dean”, but what grabbed us most about it was the belief that this part of the Forest of Dean was the inspiration for the Forests of Middle Earth (the mythical land imagined by J. R. R. Tolkien in The Lord of the Rings, for those Philistines who don’t know what/where Middle Earth is!). On arrival, it didn’t look like much….</p>

                            <p>At the end of last month Microsoft released their Consumer Preview for Windows 8 and, as usual, I couldn’t resist the temptation, so I promptly downloaded the ISO to have a play :-). Now I think it’s about time I shared my experience with you. Installation As you would expect with a new release of Windows, the installation process is once again very simple. Insert the CD into the drive and boot the computer Select your language, time &amp; currency, and your keyboard layout Click Install Now Enter your product code and agree to the Terms &amp; Conditions Select install type (Upgrade or Custom/Clean install) Choose where to install Once Windows has completed the installation…</p>

                            <p>The day we have been waiting for for the last 9 months finally arrived on Monday night… the contractions began! After a few brief hours keeping the neighbours awake, we headed out to Nevill Hall Hospital for the start of a new life to begin. We were rushed through to the delivery suite and told that Rosie was already really far along so we needed to get the baby out asap. Some more screaming and heavy breathing ensued until, finally, at 13:47 the midwife announced… It’s a boy! What an incredible feeling. It’s absolutely indescribable how utterly brilliant I felt getting that news. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m 100% positive I would have felt…</p>

                            <p>Today marks the end of a rather significant chapter in my life, and the start of a brand new one. Four weeks ago I handed my notice in at my current job having accepted a job working in the family business. I have worked with BAM Construction since the end of my second year at University. Over the last six and a half years, BAM have nurtured me and brought me from a bumbling University student to a calm and collected Chartered Quantity Surveyor. BAM have thrown me into various scenarios that have enabled me to grow and progress well in my time with them. In the early days, I worked on a site that was running very…</p>
