After a busy start to the weekend sorting out George's bedroom, Rosie and I both took part in the
[Pontypool 10k Home Run][hr] on Sunday morning. The event is organised by [St Davids Hospice Care][]
and is always very popular (_not quite as popular as the [Lliswerry 8][l8], but it does always sell
out_). So far I have not managed to get myself sorted early enough to get a place, so this year I
booked a place almost as soon as the entries opened, and Rosie booked a place shortly after.
