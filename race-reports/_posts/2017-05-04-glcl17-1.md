The [Gwent Leisure Centre League][glcl] is one of the highlights of the racing
calendar for me (_well, the road races are at least_). It's a free series of ten
races for club runners in Gwent, five road races between May and August and five
cross country races between October and March. It can get really competitive,
but in the best possible way :smiley:. The road races are always on a Tuesday
evening so usually I can make all the races. As a club we really get involved in
the series, we always have a great turnout and we finish every race with a pile
of cakes :yum:. This was no exception. The first race of the series this year
was at the furthest away venue, but when I got there it was absolutely heaving.
