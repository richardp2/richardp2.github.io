  After a busy start to the weekend sorting out George's bedroom, Rosie and I both took part in the
  Pontypool 10k Home Run on Sunday morning. The event is organised by St Davids Hospice Care and is
  always very popular (not quite as popular as the Lliswerry 8, but it does always sell out). So far
  I have not managed to get myself sorted early enough to get a place, so this year I booked a place
  almost as soon as the entries opened, and Rosie booked a place shortly after. I have run the route
  many times as it is so close to home, but this was the first time I have actually run the Home
  Run. It was a great race, and I will be competing again, despite the slightly boring generic 10k
  race medal we received at the end...

This weekend it was the [Admiral City of Newport Half Marathon][nhm]. Another popular local race
organised by [St Davids Hospice Care][sdhc]. This year I was well aware that I was not in shape to
run a PB so, I made the decision to use this as a long tempo run instead. This meant taking it
steady(ish) right from the start. I parked up at Newport Stadium again this year with a view to
walking over to the start as a bit of a warm up but, as usual, I was running a little late so I
ended up jogging the 2 miles to the bag drop to make sure I got there in time. With my bag dropped
off, I headed to the start line.

This year the race was started by Darren Campbell. We headed off towards the transporter bridge and
I settled into a good pace that I felt I could keep up for the duration, based on my running
recently. The race was going well, the sun was out, the crowds were cheering and I felt good. Coming
through Caerleon there was a lot of support from the [club][crc] and the locals so it was good. The
wind was quite strong along the cycle path, but as I wasn't looking for a PB, I wasn't worried. The
1:35 pace group dragged me along for a little while, but I managed to let them go in Caerleon so I
had a bit more space. Unfortunately when I got to about 9 miles everything got a whole lot more
difficult!
