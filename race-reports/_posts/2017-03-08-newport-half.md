  This weekend it was the Admiral City of Newport Half Marathon. Another popular local race
  organised by St Davids Hospice Care. This year I was well aware that I was not in shape to
  run a PB so, I made the decision to use this as a long tempo run instead. This meant taking it
  steady(ish) right from the start. I parked up at Newport Stadium again this year with a view to
  walking over to the start as a bit of a warm up but, as usual, I was running a little late so I
  ended up jogging the 2 miles to the bag drop to make sure I got there in time. With my bag dropped
  off, I headed to the start line...

This weekend it was the [Admiral City of Newport Half Marathon][nhm]. Another popular local race
organised by [St Davids Hospice Care][sdhc]. This year I was well aware that I was not in shape to
run a PB so, I made the decision to use this as a long tempo run instead. This meant taking it
steady(ish) right from the start. I parked up at Newport Stadium again this year with a view to
walking over to the start as a bit of a warm up but, as usual, I was running a little late so I
ended up jogging the 2 miles to the bag drop to make sure I got there in time. With my bag dropped
off, I headed to the start line.

This year the race was started by Darren Campbell. We headed off towards the transporter bridge and
I settled into a good pace that I felt I could keep up for the duration, based on my running
recently. The race was going well, the sun was out, the crowds were cheering and I felt good. Coming
through Caerleon there was a lot of support from the [club][crc] and the locals so it was good. The
wind was quite strong along the cycle path, but as I wasn't looking for a PB, I wasn't worried. The
1:35 pace group dragged me along for a little while, but I managed to let them go in Caerleon so I
had a bit more space. Unfortunately when I got to about 9 miles everything got a whole lot more
difficult! For some reason, my legs just seemed to give up the ghost and it was like I was trying to
run with lead boots. I really struggled with those last 4 miles and even walked for a fair bit. It
was not a pleasant experience, but I finished :smiley:. I'm not entirely sure what happened given it
all seemed to be going well up to 9 miles, but as I wasn't going for a PB I don't really mind. The
only problem was that it took away from the enjoyment of the event. [St Davids Hospice Care][sdhc]
have put together a good half marathon, the weather was great (_apart from some of the high winds we
experienced_), the medal and t-shirt were really nice, but I didn't enjoy the last couple of miles
:disappointed: which is a bit of a shame.

Ah well, I just need to put this one behind me and start preparing for my next race, which is the 
[Gloucester City Marathon][gcm] on 06 August 2017 at 08:00. I'm really looking forward to this one
and to getting back into marathon training again. Hopefully this time, the course will have been 
accurately measured :wink:.
