  This past Sunday, I ran the Lliswerry 8 Road Race for the second time. It is a fantastic race 
  organised by Lliswerry Runners and it is absolutely flat! This picture shows me running up the
  only 'hill' on the entire course. The event itself was very well organised, despite the issues
  with the online entries (which were handled very well by the event organisers) and everything went
  very smoothly I think. During the race the marshalls were all very cheery and supportive and the
  overall atmosphere of the event was excellent. After the race, back at the stadium, there was a
  huge selection of cakes laid on which is always a good thing in my book. Thank you Lliswerry
  Runners for a great race to start off the year...

This past Sunday, I ran the [Lliswerry 8][l8] Road Race for the second time. It is a fantastic race 
organised by [Lliswerry Runners][ll] and it is absolutely flat! The picture above shows me running
up the only 'hill' on the entire course. 

I arrived at registration at about 10:30, picked up my race number and timing chip and was ready to
go in less than 5 minutes. I met up with a load of the guys from [club][crc], but we didn't start
heading over to the start too early due to the weather conditions. The forecast was predicting heavy
rain all day, which would have made for some treacherous running conditions, but thankfully the
heavy rain held off and we only had to contend with fairly light rain (_which actually kept me
cool_). I got off to a reasonable start, but unfortunately I started to drop away from the other
guys at around the 2 mile mark. My legs felt heavy and my pace steadily declined and people
continued to pass me for the remainder of the race. It was quite demoralising having people
continually passing me, but I still managed to keep a reasonable pace and I finished just over
2&frac12; minutes behind my time from last year. Although I am slightly disappointed with the
performance this year, I took nearly a month off over Christmas and haven't been very consistent
with training so far this year, so it's not really surprising. In fact, given all that I think I
did much better than I should have :smiley:.

The event itself was very well organised, despite the issues with the online entries (_which were
handled very well by the event organisers_) and everything went very smoothly I think. During the
race the marshalls were all very cheery and supportive and the overall atmosphere of the event was
excellent. After the race, back at the stadium, there was a huge selection of cakes laid on which is 
always a good thing in my book :wink:. 

There is no doubt that I will be taking part in this event again in the future (_especially given
it's a local event_), and I will have no hesitation staying up until the early hours of the morning
to make sure I get a place :smiley:. 

Thank you [Lliswerry Runners][ll] for a great race to start off the year.
