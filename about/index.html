            <section class="post-content" itemProp="articleBody">
              <p>My name is Richard Perry. I have lived in Wales my whole life, excluding the 18 months following
my birth and the 4 years whilst at Uni, I therefore identify myself as Welsh. I studied Quantity
Surveying and Commercial Management at the University of the West of England in Bristol, and
landed a job with <a href="http://www.bam.co.uk/" title="BAM Construct UK Ltd">BAM Construction</a> (formerly HBG Construction) half way
through. I continued studying after Uni and gained professional status with the Royal Institute
of Chartered Surveyors in 2009. In late 2011 I left BAM to work in the
<a href="http://www.cpconstruction.co.uk/" title="CP Construction (Gwent) Ltd">family business</a>.</p>

<h4 id="scouting">Scouting</h4>

<p>I joined Scouting in 1992 when I was 8 years old and continued through the sections all the way
up to Venture Scouts. Then as Explorer Scouts and Network where being introduced, I somehow
managed to get myself roped into helping set up the first Explorer Scout Unit in our District.
Almost a year later <a href="http://www.freespiritesu.org.uk/" title="FreeSpirit Explorer Scout Unit">FreeSpirit ESU</a> was born under the leadership of Simon Fairless with
me helping out whilst I was at Uni. Well I’m still there and we’ve grown to be quite a large
Unit with almost 40 members and 6 leaders at the moment.</p>

<p>Scouting has been a big part of my life, giving me some amazing experiences and memories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 2001 I was able to take part in an Explorer Belt Expedition in The Gambia, which kick started a love of travelling, languages and culture;</li>
  <li>In 2005, at Eurojam (European Jamboree) in Essex, I met my wife, Rosie :-);</li>
  <li>In 2006 we took <a href="http://www.freespiritesu.org.uk/" title="FreeSpirit Explorer Scout Unit">FreeSpirit ESU</a> to the Serbian National Jamboree as part of the Welsh Contingent. Whilst we were there we visited Budapest (Hungary), Belgrade and Niš;</li>
  <li>In 2006/7 I took part in the Mafikeng Centenary Moot in Mafikeng, South Africa where we celebrated the start of the Centenary Year of Scouting at its birthplace, before travelling Cape Town for some extended celebrations;</li>
  <li>In 2007 I joined the Faith &amp; Beliefs team at the 21st World Scout Jamboree teaching Scouts from all over the World about Buddhism, and learning much from all of them;</li>
  <li>In 2009 I participated in the Three Nations Expedition to <del>Russia</del>, China and Mongolia, following this, Rosie and I toured around China for a further 5 weeks.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="travellingtra"><a href="http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/" title="Rosie &amp; Jim's Travel Blog">Travelling</a></h4>

<p>I was bitten by the travelling bug in 2001, and ever since then I have wanted to travel the
world. Unfortunately this was not really a viable option until I got a proper job. So I only
really started travelling properly in 2006 when we took the Unit to Serbia. We took the
decision to add 5 days to the start and finish of the Jamboree so we could visit Budapest and
Belgrade, and since then we haven’t really stopped…</p>

<p>Until now! We are now taking a short sabbatical from the travelling we love so much to have a
baby. I am really looking forward to having a third person around the house, but even more than
that, I am looking forward to showing our little one the world. Initially from home, but
eventually in person.</p>

<p>Since our tour of China in 2009, I have had a keen interest in Chinese language, food and
culture and since we found out that Rosie was pregnant, I doubled my efforts to improve my
Mandarin in the (vain) hope that we could raise George bilingually. However, I have not really
reached a level that could be considered even close to fluent (actually I’m more of a beginner
still) so although I am still learning, I am not teaching George in the manner I had hoped. I
am, however, having a lot of fun with it so I won’t be giving up any time soon.</p>

<h4 id="photographyphotography"><a href="/photography/">Photography</a></h4>

<p>Travelling has also introduced me to photography. I bought my first digital camera before going
to Serbia and thoroughly enjoyed trying to get the best picture and capture the moment, and so
as my hobby grew I started saving and bought my first SLR before going to China. Since then I
have been desperately trying to improve my photography to get the kind of photos you see on
postcards. I have also come to the conclusion that this is going to take some time, but I’m please
to say that I have captured a few images that I am incredibly proud of. All my travel photos and
some of my other photos are showcased on <a href="http://photos.perry-online.me.uk/" title="Rosie &amp; Jim's Photo Gallery">our photosite</a>.</p>

<h4 id="computers">Computers</h4>

<p>I am also a bit of a geek! There I said it. I spend an inordinate amount of time tinkering with
(and often breaking) computers. This includes hardware and software. I have a server running at
home that has been rebuilt 3 or 4 times for various, not very good, reasons. It handles all sorts
of services that we probably don’t need, and until recently, it also served our
<a href="http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/" title="Rosie &amp; Jim's Travel Blog">travel blog</a> to the world. Due to the number of problems I
was having with reliability, this has now been outsourced. My main systems have always been
custom-made since my Uncle donated his computer to me as a teenager and I find it difficult to
find what I want in systems that I can buy off the shelf (like I said, GEEK!!)</p>

<p>I have built a number of websites over the years including this one. I started by writing website
in pure HTML, then I discovered PHP and coded things in PHP from scratch for a while. For my own
site I chose to use <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress">WordPress</a> as I wanted to create a <a href="http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/" title="Rosie &amp; Jim's Travel Blog">travel blog</a>. This opened my
eyes to the wonders of CMS’s (although granted WordPress is not truly a CMS) and since then I
have started to make better use of systems that other people have built with tweaks to suit
myself. I am now in the process of rebuilding the <a href="http://www.freespiritesu.org.uk/" title="FreeSpirit Explorer Scout Unit">FreeSpirit ESU</a> site in its entirety
using WordPress 3.0 with custom post types and custom plugins to suit our Unit’s specific needs.</p>

<h4 id="languageslanguages"><a href="/languages/">Languages</a></h4>

<p>When I was in school taking my options for GCSE I chose to take 2 optional languages through to
GCSE (French and German). This was due to an interest in languages, but unfortunately I didn’t
carry either of them on to A Level due to a number of factors. This led to me losing touch with
Foreign Languages completely. However, in 2009 when we were in China, I made the decision to make
a concerted effort to learn as much Mandarin as I could to help us whilst we were there. This was
very helpful and even helped  us convince a restaurant (in Mandarin) that one of their cold dishes
should be heated up for a vegetarian friend of ours. I really enjoyed learning the language, but
didn’t keep it up as I planned, so now I have taken it upon myself to teach myself Mandarin so that
I can teach George Mandarin to give him a second language.</p>
