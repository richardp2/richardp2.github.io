          <title>Memories: Three Nations 2009</title>

          <description><![CDATA[ 
    <p>2009 was a fantastic year for many reasons. Both Rosie and I completed our professional training, 
with me receiving my <abbr title="Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors">RICS</abbr> Chartership and Rosie completing here <abbr title="National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health">NEBOSH</abbr> Construction Safety
Certificate. This was quite an important milestone in both our lives, so we decided to celebrate in
the only way that we know how…we went travelling <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</p>

<p>After a brilliant trip to <a href="/general/memories/africa-06-07/">South Africa</a> we decided to join
Troll and the gang on their next adventure to Russia, Mongolia and China. The Three Nations trip
also seemed like a good springboard for further travel. Unfortunately, the Russian leg of the trip
had to be removed due to the significant cost implications, but spending 10 days living in a Ger on
the Steppes of Mongolia more than made up for that!</p>

<p>We spent a couple of days in Beijing seeing some of the sights before heading to Ulaanbaatar and the
grasslands beyond to experience nomadic living. We:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spent a day with a nomadic family;</li>
  <li>evacuated our ‘home’ due to an extreme flash flood;</li>
  <li>helped do some refurbishment works to a local Buddhist Temple and a local Scout hut;</li>
  <li>hiked, and cleared litter, through the National Park;</li>
  <li>participated in our very own Naadam (Наадам) festival;</li>
  <li>and met up with our friend, Gankhuyag Magsarjav, from the 
<a href="/general/memories/world-jamboree-07/">World Jamboree</a> for a teaching at his Monastery
<img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was fantastic, but it also wasn’t the end. We then headed back to Beijing to do some more of the
touristy thing. We:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visited the Terracotta Warriors in Xi’an travelling by overnight train in each direction;</li>
  <li>visited the Ming Tombs on route to the Great Wall;</li>
  <li>and slept on the Great Wall of China, yes slept, before hiking along it the following morning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best memories from the Three Nations trip include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>walking into the Forbidden City;</li>
  <li>getting absolutely soaked to the skin during more than one ridiculous ‘shower’ (we don’t really
know what rain is in this country compared to China &amp; Mongolia!);</li>
  <li>flipping poo to help it dry for use in the stove;</li>
  <li>watching huge Gers moving across a hillside with dozens of feet sticking out the bottom;</li>
  <li>having a shower (and sauna <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />) after a week of washing with a bucket of water or wet wipes;</li>
  <li>haggling in the frenetic indoor markets in Beijing;</li>
  <li>sleeping on the Great Wall of China;</li>
  <li>trying to convince staff in a local restaurant that we wanted one of their dishes served hot
instead of cold, in Mandarin. They thought we were getting our words wrong until we found out how
to say that we knew it should be cold, we just wanted it hot <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was just the beginning of our travelling this year, but the rest will have to wait. For more
information about the Three Nations Expedition, we kept a blog <a href="//travel.perry-online.me.uk/china-2009/three-nations/">here</a>.</p>

          <title>Memories: Switzerland 2008</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/general/memories/switzerland-08/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2014 20:44:59 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Richard Perry (richard@perrymail.me.uk)</author>
          <guid>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/general/memories/switzerland-08/</guid>
          <description><![CDATA[ 
    <p>In 2008 we decided that we should try to have a non-scouting holiday for just the two of us. Well,
we half managed it. We chose to go to Switzerland for a week, without the <a href="//freespiritesu.org.uk/" title="FreeSpirit Explorer Scouts">Explorer’s</a> and not
as part of a Network event, but we stayed at <a href="//www.kisc.ch/" title="Kandersteg International Scout Centre">Kandersteg International Scout Centre</a> <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.
The main reason for this is the extortionate prices of hotels in Switzerland. Ok, they’re not
extortionate, but we couldn’t really afford them so we chose the cheaper option. It cost us a total
of £9 per person per night to stay at Kandersteg in bunkhouse accommodation. We even got our own
room because it was out of season <img class="emoji" title="wink" alt="wink" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wink.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</p>

<p>The basic concept of this holiday was to actually relax and enjoy each others company and that is
exactly what we did. Each morning we got up and either had breakfast at the centre or headed out for
breakfast on the hoof, jumped on the train somewhere, explored the area and came back to the centre
after having dinner out. It isn’t easy to get anywhere from Kandersteg without a rail ticket so we
were grateful that we spent the extra money on one at the airport because it turned out to be vital
to us actually seeing Switzerland for a sensible price.</p>

<p>During the week, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visited the Jungfraujoch;</li>
  <li>Walked on the Aletsch Glacier;</li>
  <li>Watched some of the Freestyle Kayak World Cup 2008 in Thun (completely by accident <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />);</li>
  <li>Visited Interlaken, Lauterbrunnen, Spiez, Zermatt, Berne and Grindelwald;</li>
  <li>Tried to see the Matterhorn, but it was completely covered in cloud;</li>
  <li>Saw the North Face of the Eiger;</li>
  <li>And generally had an amazing time. We will definitely be visiting again <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole holiday was very relaxed, even with all the travelling around the country, and I would 
definitely stay at <a href="//www.kisc.ch/" title="Kandersteg International Scout Centre">KISC</a> again. </p>

          <description><![CDATA[ 
    <p>Ok so I’m only on the third post in this series and I’m already getting behind, but I will try to be
better, honest <img class="emoji" title="wink" alt="wink" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wink.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</p>

<p>In 2007 we celebrated 100 years of Scouting. The main event of the year was the 
<a href="//www.scout.org/node/6948" title="21st World Scout Jamboree">21st World Scout Jamboree</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> which was held in Hylands Park, Chelmsford. Rosie and I
volunteered to join the International Service Team to work at the Jamboree, and we worked in the
Buddhist Tent in the Faith &amp; Beliefs Zone with Troll<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. I realise that this isn’t technically
travel, but it does hold some great memories and we did meet and interact with people from all over
the world <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</p>

<p>The Jamboree itself was just under 2 weeks long, but we arrived a couple of days before to help get
everything set up. It was during these first couple of days when the Thai Scouts gift to the Scout
Association arrived. It was a huge Buddha statue that would be the centrepiece of our tent for the
duration of the Jamboree, and would then find it’s new home in the Sala at <a href="//www.scoutactivitycentres.org.uk/locations/gilwellpark/" title="Gilwell Park">Gilwell Park</a>. We
set up two different types of Buddhist shrines (Thai/Theravada and Vajrayana) in our new home and
were joined by two Buddhist monks (Gankhuyag Magsarjav, Mongolia &amp; Ming Kuang, Taiwan) for the
duration of the Jamboree.</p>

<p>It was a fascinating couple of weeks. We met a vast range of people with dramatically differing
viewpoints that sparked some interesting conversations on faith, beliefs and our place in the
universe. It wasn’t just Buddhist Scouts that visited us either, we had visitors from every faith &amp;
most of the countries (≅ 158) that were represented at the Jamboree. It was quite humbling
really.</p>

<p>However, for me, the most important and memorable experience I had at the Jamboree was taking 
<a href="//www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s17.htm">refuge</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> in the Buddha, the Dharma &amp; the Sangha. Myself and a friend of mine, Michael
McClafferty, celebrated our refuge ceremony on Sunrise Day. This was the main celebratory day of the
Jamboree with a Sunrise Ceremony in the morning and all sorts of Internationally Themed events
happening across the whole site. The ceremony was carried out by Lama Gankhuyag Magsarjav who became
a good friend to all of us during the course of the Jamboree and we both felt privileged for him to
be so involved in our refuge ceremony.</p>

      <p>Perhaps a few of you need a little bit of an explanation here, I follow the teachings of Buddha and as such I am Buddhist. I realised that my beliefs aligned with the Buddhist faith in 2005 and have identified myself as such ever since <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          <description><![CDATA[ 
    <p>It was on top of a big rock in the Lake District that Rosie was invited to a Scout Camp in South
Africa in 2005 shortly before we met. At the beginning of the following year we signed up and we
definitely didn’t regret it <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />. </p>

<p>So, on 27 December 2006 we set off to South Africa for the Mafikeng Centenary Moot<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> with a brief
stop in Abu Dhabi, where we ventured a small way out of the airport just to get the passport stamp
<img class="emoji" title="wink" alt="wink" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wink.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />. The Moot was held in Mafikeng, the birthplace of Scouting, and this was where we saw in the
New Year at the beginning of the Centenary Year of Scouting. It was pretty awesome! </p>

<p>Over the next 10 days we helped with community projects at a local school and a local Scout hut,
participated in the gruelling BP Trail<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, slept out in the <a href="//www.parksnorthwest.co.za/mafikeng_reserve/" title="Mafikeng Game Reserve">Mafikeng Game Reserve</a>, planted
trees along the side of a road<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and generally had a great time with Scouts from a large number of
South African nations, the UK, Austria, Finland and Sweden. </p>

<p>After the Moot ended, we had a couple of days at <a href="//www.pilanesberg-game-reserve.co.za/" title="Pilanesburg Game Reserve">Pilanesburg Game Reserve</a> to see the Big 5.
We were camped in the park and woke up to see monkeys (of some kind) running around the camping
area. It was great and we did two safaris to try to see everything <img class="emoji" title="grinning" alt="grinning" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/grinning.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</p>

<p>We then jumped on a train from Johannesburg to Cape Town<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> for a couple of days R&amp;R. Whilst there,
we climbed up, slept on top of, and abseiled off Table Mountain, played with penguins on Boulders
Beach, visited the local Scout Shop and basically chilled out. It was definitely a good way to see
Cape Town. We stayed with a local Scout Group and took full advantage of their local knowledge to
make sure we saw the best of Cape Town during our short stay. </p>

<p>We ended our South African adventure with another 26 hour train ride back to Jo’burg and a day at a
local theme park before flying back to the UK. It was another brilliant adventure where we made some
great new friends <img class="emoji" title="smiley" alt="smiley" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smiley.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

      <p>A Moot is an International Scouting event for those aged between 18 and 25 (<small>although the upper limit can vary slightly depending on the organising country</small>) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>The BP Trail was advertised (<small>to us at least </small>) as a nice little walk with some historic significance to the Boa War and the birth of Scouting. In actual fact it was a full days march around Mafikeng with little opportunity to refuel or fill water bottles. Many of us struggled with it, especially in the heat, but it was definitely a memorable experience for all that took part <img class="emoji" title="wink" alt="wink" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wink.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" /> <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>These trees did not look the healthiest when we started, and we had a limited water supply so no-one involved really expected the trees to survive, but it was the gesture that mattered on this occasion (<small>I think</small>) <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:4">
      <p>The journey was 26/27 hours with no air conditioning and plastic seats, so it was uncomfortable to say the least. We did, however, manage to have a great time! It probably helped there being 88 of us on the train <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" /> <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          <description><![CDATA[ 
    <p>Over the next few months I’m going to do a series of posts looking back on the holidays and
travelling Rosie &amp; I have done since we met. It won’t include everything, but each week I will post
a gallery of the memories from a single holiday with a little bit of text describing my/our best
memories from that holiday. I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>This week we are looking back on our Explorer Scout Summer Camp in Serbia. Rosie &amp; I were part of
the leadership team for the Welsh Contingent of Scouts at the Serbian National Jamboree. However,
we decided that being as were would be in that part of the world, we would extend the trip and do a
bit of independant travel whilst we were at it.</p>

<p>The Jamboree itself was due to be held in Niš in Southern Serbia, but we couldn’t fly direct.
Instead, we flew to Budapest, Hungary and travelled by train/bus down to Niš. Rosie &amp; I left the UK
a couple of days early to spend some time in Belgrade before heading down to the Jamboree. We stayed
in a youth hostel where we met some really friendly backpackers and learnt how to make Turkish
coffee. It was brilliant, but one thing we need to remember for the future is that Serbian maps
don’t necessarily show all the streets. It took us ages to find our hostel <img class="emoji" title="grinning" alt="grinning" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/grinning.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />. Belgrade is
a beautiful city, full of contrasts, that at some point we will revisit.</p>

<p>We then decided to take a bus down to Niš to meet up with the Unit at the Jamboree. When we got
there we found that the Jamboree hadn’t even been set up, but within 24 hours everything was ready.
It really was a contrast to the 2-3 week build periods we have for Jamborees in the UK. The Jamboree
itself was excellent and if you want more details please visit the <a href="//freespiritesu.org.uk/campdiaries/serbia06/" title="Serbia 2006">blog</a> on
<a href="//freespiritesu.org.uk/" title="FreeSpirit ESU">FreeSpirit ESU</a>’s site. Some of our fondest memories of Niš include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the bar at the bottom of the hill from the site, which sold the best burgers in the world!;</li>
  <li>the price of beer (approx. 90p for 2 litres);</li>
  <li>the day at the lake;</li>
  <li>and the incredible experience of a Jamboree run so differently to what we are used to <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the rest of our Unit were bundled in a bus for a couple of days in Northern Serbia, Rosie and
I headed back to Budapest for a couple of days sightseeing. We got to see Attilla the Hun Street,
the parliament building, St Stephens Basilica, the children’s railway and some crazy locals with
pool noodles all over them! We even got to learn &amp; practice some Hungarian with a waiter at Pizza
Hut <img class="emoji" title="smiley" alt="smiley" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smiley.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />.</p>

          <title>Tweaking Jekyll to Suit My Needs</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/technology/jekyll/tweaking/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2014 07:36:28 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Richard Perry (richard@perrymail.me.uk)</author>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>This is going to be my last post on my Migration from <a href="//wordpress.org/" title="WordPress &#8250; Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS">WordPress</a> to <a href="//jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll &bull; Simple, blog-aware, static sites">Jekyll</a> 
(<em>I promise <img class="emoji" title="blush" alt="blush" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/blush.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" /></em>). This week I am going to share with you some of the changes I’ve made, and
plugins I’ve adapted to get everything running the way it was (<small>ish</small>) in WordPress.
I’ve had to make a few changes to the site to suit the new system as well, but nothing major.</p>

<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>

<p>You may have noticed (<small>but probably not really, that’s kind of the point</small>) that there
are no longer any tags listed at the bottom of each post. Tags are a standard part of WordPress that
I embraced for no other reason than ‘they were there’. Their purpose was to allow navigation between
posts of similar topics that were not necessarily in the same category. To be honest, I don’t write
all that many posts, and I don’t have thousands of people rading my blog so I decided they were
completely unnecessary and ditched them in the migration.</p>

<h3 id="categories">Categories</h3>

<p>I have also made a few changes to the categories. This is partially due to the way Jekyll handles
categories, and partially due to me wanting to rationlise it a bit. In Jekyll, posts cannot be linked
to multiple categories in the same way as WordPress. If there are multiple categories listed, they
become subcategories of each other. For this reason, I had to adjust some of them so that they
worked properly. For example, if an Instagram picture post included George, I filed it in both the
Photography category and the George category. In Jekyll, this results in the post being included in
the Photography/George (<small>or George/Photography depending on the order</small>) category, not
two separate ones.</p>

<p>Jekyll does not generate category pages for you, so I looked at a few options for achieving this.
Firstly, I made use of a standard plugin for generating the pages. I then made a few modifications
to the plugin to get a result I preferred, and finally I adopted part of the plugin for generating
the category list displayed at the top of each post and ditched the rest in favour of coding my own
category pages. The plugin I am now using looks a little bit like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="c1"># Category Links Filter</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The original plugin was created by Dave Perrett and is available here:</span>
<span class="c1"># http://recursive-design.com/projects/jekyll-plugins/</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The modifications include:</span>
<span class="c1">#   - Removing category page generation classes completely</span>
<span class="c1">#   - Modified the category_dir function to only use the first word in</span>
<span class="c1">#     multiword categories and to link them together to create the path</span>
<span class="c1">#   - Modified the category_links function to use titlecase for the </span>
<span class="c1">#     displayed category names</span>

<h3 id="pages">Pages</h3>

<p>The way pages are organised in Jekyll is a little too messy for my liking so I have adopted a simple
plugin that will keep pages organised in the same way as posts. They sit in a folder called ‘_pages’
rather than in the root of the repository. This keeps the root folder tidier <img class="emoji" title="smile" alt="smile" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" />. The plugin was
written by Ben Baker-Smith and is available from <a href="//github.com/bbakersmith/jekyll-pages-directory" title="Jekyll Pages Plugin">here</a></p>

<h3 id="draft-post-publishing">Draft Post Publishing</h3>

<p>Also in Jekyll, drafts are kept separate in a ‘_drafts’ folder, but there is no real way to handle 
them when they are ready to publish other than to move the file to the ‘_posts’ folder and rename it
prior to deploying the update. This is not a difficult task, but they is a better way. <a href="//rake.rubyforge.org/" title="Rake -- Ruby Make">Rake</a> 
is a build program that is used by a lot of web programmers to automate simple, but time consuming
tasks. This seemed to me to be the perfect solution, but my distinct lack of skills in <a href="//ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby Programming Language">Ruby</a> 
meant I had to start with <a href="//google.co.uk/" title="Google">Google</a>. This led me to a script by <a href="//www.shaneburkhart.me/" title="Shane Burkhart">Shane Burkhart</a> that was
almost exactly what I wanted. With a few minor tweaks I ended up with this:</p>

<p>This also led me to automating a load of different tasks to generally make my life easier. If you’re

.</p>

<h3 id="series">Series</h3>

<p>My final tweak for the site was to reintroduce Post Series like I had on WordPress. The idea of a
series is that posts about the same topic (like this one) include a list of all the related posts at
the beginning of the post so that anyone reading it can refer back if they are interested. This is
again not a standard function of Jekyll, but with a bit of research I found a great plugin written
by <a href="//realjenius.com/" title="Real Jenius">R.J. Lorimer</a> that was just what I needed. (As usual) I made a few modifications and this
is the result:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="c1"># Series List Tag</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The original plugin was created by R.J. Lorimer and is available here:</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># The modifications include:</span>
<span class="c1">#   - Using a data file (series.yml) to add more detail to the series</span>
<span class="c1">#   - Modified the output of the tag to look the way I wanted it to</span>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, and previously the last couple of months, I’ve documented the process
I’ve gone through to migrate my blog from WordPress to Jekyll. Hopefully some of it has been
interesting to some people, but really I’ve written it as a reference for myself. </p>

<p>I have very much enjoyed learning about Jekyll and how it works, as well as bits of a new
programming language, but mostly I’ve enjoyed tinkering with something that already works fine. I
feel that I am definitely a bit of a tinkerer, but there’s no harm in it really, is there? <img class="emoji" title="wink" alt="wink" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wink.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" /></p>

          <title>Converting the Posts</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/technology/jekyll/converting/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2014 19:32:31 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Richard Perry (richard@perrymail.me.uk)</author>
          <guid>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/technology/jekyll/converting/</guid>
          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>The next step in the migration to <a href="//jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll &bull; Simple, blog-aware, static sites">Jekyll</a> was to export my existing blog posts from <a href="//wordpress.org/" title="WordPress &#8250; Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS">WordPress</a>
and then convert them into <a href="//daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> format so they can be used in the new blog. There are a
number of different options for doing this, including Jekyll’s own migration option <a href="//import.jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll Import">Jekyll Import</a>
Bearing in mind the purpose of the move was purely academic there was no need to rush this step so I
tried a number of different options to see which one worked best for me. In the end, I used a little
<a href="//python.org/" title="Welcome to Python.org">Python</a> script written by <a href="//thomas.jossystem.se/" title="Thomas Frössman">Thomas Frössman</a> called <a href="//github.com/thomasf/exitwp" title="Exitwp">Exitwp</a>. The Jekyll script was ok,
but it pulled some random data from the WP SEO plugin that I was using, and didn’t properly convert
the existing posts to proper Markdown.</p>

<p>Once Exitwp had converted all my posts to Markdown, I had to go through and make amendments to each
file to ensure it was displayed correctly. This was not the fault of Exitwp, but my own personal
preferences. I have setup a number of posts to display a certain way, and to include things in a
specific position on the page so I had to make adjustments to suit this. For example, thumbnails in
my posts can be on the left or the right of the page, or a large image could be included in the
centre of the page. Jekyll’s default Markdown engine doesn’t support setting classes on different
elements so I chose the <a href="//kramdown.gettalong.org/" title="Kramdown">Kramdown</a> engine rather than using html. This meant I needed to make a
few alterations to make sure the posts rendered correctly when the site is generated.</p>

<p>As part of the migration process, I also decided that I wanted to move all my photo hosting to
<a href="//flickr.com/" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>, especially considering the 1TB of free file storage available there. So I set up a 
<a href="//flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/collections/72157641951146185/" title="Blogs Collection">collection</a> on Flickr for all my blog photos and I then had to change the image links in all
my posts to match the new flickr image locations. To achieve this I used a couple of Jekyll plugins
for Liquid tags which meant I simply had to include <code>{% flickr_image 0000000 %}</code>
in the markdown file to show an image with a link back to Flickr (<em><small>as per the terms of my
Flickr account</small></em>), or <code>{% flickr_photoset 0000000 %}</code> to show a gallery
generated from a Flickr Photoset with the relevant links back to Flickr. </p>

          <title>Planning the Migration</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/technology/jekyll/planning/</link>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>As mentioned in my previous <a href="/technology/jekyll/jekyll/" title="Moving from WordPress to Jekyll">post</a>, I recently decided it would be a good idea to move my blog away 
from <a href="//wordpress.org/" title="WordPress &#8250; Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS">WordPress</a> and onto <a href="//pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a> making use of <a href="//jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll &bull; Simple, blog-aware, static sites">Jekyll</a>, the static site
generator to simplify my site. I chose to do this for two simple reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My blog is very simple so doesn’t need the power of WordPress;</li>
  <li>I can’t resist tinkering with things.</li>
</ol>

<p>Realistically, the latter was the biggest driver in my decision. I came across this new idea that
seemed interesting and decided to give it a go :-).</p>

<h3 id="where-to-start">Where to Start</h3>

<p>First of all, I had to look at what was needed to setup a Jekyll site. There are so many tutorials
out there that this bit was easy. So I started by setting myself up a free development environment 
on <a href="//nitrous.io/" title="Nitrous.IO">Nitrous.io</a> and a Git <a href="//github.com/richardp2/richardp2.github.io/" title="richardp2/richardp2.github.io · GitHub">repository</a> at <a href="//github.com/" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>. GitHub Pages also allowed me to
generate a basic sample site once I had completed setup of the repository. I thought this would be a
good way to get started but, it turns out I was wrong. Although the sample site generated by GitHub
Pages looked good, it was very basic and aimed specifically a site for your hosted code. I therefore
opted to start from scratch with a Jekyll setup.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-jekyll">Setting Up Jekyll</h3>

<p>Nitrous.io essentially gives you a linux based virtual machine with shell access that you can use as
a remote development environment. This allows you to work on your coding projects from anywhere
without having to worry about dependency issues on various different systems. So once I had setup an
account, all I had to do was log into the system and it was ready to go. I checked that the version
of <a href="//ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby Programming Language">Ruby</a> on the system was compatible with Jekyll, installed Jekyll and setup a new site. </p>

<p>The new site generated by Jekyll includes the basic file structure for the site and a simple index
page. I overwrote the GitHub Pages generated site in my repository with this new site and then the
real work started. </p>

<p>I wanted my site to be fairly similar to the existing one because I actually like the design, but I
also wanted it to be more responsive (i.e. I wanted it to display just as well on a mobile phone or
tablet as it does on a computer screen). So I started by created the basic layouts for the pages and
then crafted the styling on top. To ensure it was going to display properly on all devices, I opted
for a mobile first design with media queries to amend the site layout for larger screens. </p>

<p>Once all that was complete, I had to start looking into how the convert my existing posts from
WordPress, but that will have to wait till next time :-).</p>

          <title>Why I Joined a Running Club</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/outdoors/running/</link>

<p>Ever since I started running I’ve outright dismissed the idea of joining a running club. I started
running in an effort to get fit without having to go to a gym, or go to a swimming pool etc. It was
simple, get dressed, go running. There were no barriers (other than bad weather) to prevent me going
running so it seemed to be the best option. Once I started doing it regularly, I got to really enjoy
it. I prefer running first thing in the morning so it’s always peaceful, there’s rarely anybody out 
and about to get in the way, there’s very little traffic and it’s brilliant. This is one of the big
things that put me off joining a running club. I enjoy the solitude of my runs so running with a
group of people always seemed counter intuitive. Also, having to schedule in my runs just didn’t
work for me.</p>

<h3 id="what-changed">What Changed?</h3>

<p>Last summer, right in the middle of my <a href="/general/challenges/running/50-days-to-go/" title="50 Days to Go">training</a> for the <a href="//royalparkshalf.com/" title="Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon">Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon</a>,
I became ill and I couldn’t run for ages. A couple of weeks before the half marathon I went to see
the doctor and he advised against running on my own. He had no problem with me running, just so long
as there was somebody around to look after me should anything go wrong. This obviously presented me
with a new problem. I had to get some more runs in before the half marathon to make sure I was going
to be capable of it, but how was I going to find someone to run with me? </p>

<p>It turns out a friend of ours, who is a keen runner, runs for <a href="//caerleonrunningclub.co.uk/" title="Caerleon Running Club">Caerleon Running Club</a> and they
were training for the <a href="//www.cardiffhalfmarathon.co.uk/" title="Cardiff Half Marathon">Cardiff Half Marathon</a> that was on the same day as mine. They were due
to do a long training run on the Sunday before, so Ian invited me along. I did struggle a little 
with the first run, but I went again for the Tuesday run and felt a lot better about it. This 
confirmed I would be able to run the half! Surprising though, I also really enjoyed running with the
group.</p>

<p>After the Royal Parks, I decided to try out club running a few more times, taking part in both their
standard Tuesday runs and their more structured Thursday training runs (intervals, hill sprints etc). What struck me about it was how much I enjoyed the challenge of the Thursday runs. I had done interval training before, but as part of a group, there was more emphasis on it. I pushed myself harder than I would do on my own and I was absolutely shattered at the end of each session. In terms of my running performance, this could only be a good thing :-). Also, once I committed to running with the club, I was less inclined to skip a run because I wasn’t in the mood. I found myself running more often and I felt better in general. </p>

<p>These are the key reasons that I now run for a <a href="//caerleonrunningclub.co.uk/" title="Caerleon Running Club">club</a> and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future :-). </p>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>At the back end of last year, I started migrating my various coding projects
from <a href="//subversion.apache.org/" title="Apache Subversion"><abbr title="Subversion">SVN</abbr></a> repositories stored on <a href="//code.google.com/" title="Google Code">Google Code</a> to <a href="//git-scm.com/" title="Git">Git</a> repositories stored
in multiple locations<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I found two different places for hosting my new Git
repositories based on my specific needs. Firstly, the code for work needed to be
kept private, but the rest of my code didn’t really matter. There is a lot of
choice out there, but I wasn’t looking to part with any cash. Through a little
bit of research, I came across the following options that appealed to me:</p>

  <li><a href="//bitbucket.org/" title="Bitbucket - Free source code hosting for Git and Mercurial by Bitbucket">Bitbucket</a> - which allows for unlimited public &amp; private repositories,
but a limited number of collaborators (5 user maximum);</li>
  <li><a href="//github.com/" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> - which allows for unlimited public repositories only, and
unlimited collaborators.</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided that Bitbucket was the ideal candidate for all my private
repositories, but I decided to allow for some redundancy with the public ones.
I’m therefore using GitHub for my public repositories and backing them up/
duplicating them on Bitbucket. Finding GitHub also introduced me to something
else that I found quite interesting. <a href="//pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a> is a hosting service
provided by GitHub that allows you to publish websites from your repository.
Not only that, but it works with something called <a href="//jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll &bull; Simple, blog-aware, static sites">Jekyll</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template
directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through
<a href="//daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (or <a href="//textile.sitemonks.com/">Textile</a>) and <a href="//wiki.shopify.com/Liquid/">Liquid</a> converters, and spits out a
complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your
favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind
<a href="//pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHubPages</a>, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s
page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers <strong>for free</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounded like a brilliant idea to me so I therefore decided to move away
from <a href="//wordpress.org/" title="WordPress &#8250; Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS">WordPress</a> and try out Jekyll for myself. Now, don’t get me wrong,
I still think WordPress is brilliant for what it is, but I’ve come to accept
that it is too much for me. All I actually use my website for is writing a
couple of blogs and displaying photos I have taken over the years. It is not
exactly a complicated set up.</p>

<p>I have now completed the migration of my <a href="//richard.perry-online.me.uk/" title="Richard Perry | Just Another Blog About Nothing">personal blog</a> and I’m quite
happy with the results. I took the opportunity to modify the site theme and
this is what I’ve come up with. I hope you like it :-) .</p>

<p><em>For those that are interested, I am going to be publishing a series of posts
about my move from WordPress to Jekyll including how I overcame some of the
issues it presented. The full series will be available <a href="//richard.perry-online.me.uk/general/jekyll/" title="Migrating to Jekyll">here</a>.</em></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">

      <p>Both of these (<em>SVN &amp; Git</em>) are <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" title="Revision Control | Wikipedia">version control systems</a> used for
the management of changes to documents. They are commonly used for coding
projects to enable the tracking of changes and the ability to revert to a
previous revision easily. My decision to change from one to another was
purely out of curiosity and my inability to leave things well alone :-). <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>George is now another year older so how has the second year gone?
Well, it’s been very different to the first year! Having recovered from his illness over the new year, George got back
on his feet and hasn’t really stopped since. Rosie has had to open the eyes in the back of her head to try to keep up
with him. Unfortunately, just before his first birthday, we discovered George has nut allergy so that has been
interesting, considering we used to cook everything in groundnut oil and peanut butter was our favourite breakfast
addition. Nevermind, we have adapted quite well I think and George hasn’t had any problems this year so it’s all good
:-).</p>

<p>Over the year he has definitely developed his own personality and he has grown up so much! He is yet to start speaking,
but he does say a number of words now and can sign sentences (although he doesn’t bother very often). We have had a
National Trust membership for the last year so we’ve visited lots of different old houses and gardens giving George
plenty of opportunity to run and play outside, and he seems to have loved every minute of it.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the key events in his second year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>07 February – George completed his first full year in this world</li>
  <li>26 February – George gets tooth number 9</li>
  <li>01 March – George’s 10th tooth breaks through</li>
  <li>04 March – George gets his 11th tooth</li>
  <li>15 March – George learnt to clap</li>
  <li>01 – 07 April George’s First Visit Abroad (Paris &amp; Disneyland)</li>
  <li>01 June - Hamleys Photoshoot</li>
  <li>07 June – George gets 2 new teeth</li>
  <li>08 June – Venture Photography Photoshoot &amp; George escapes his cot</li>
  <li>26 June – Georges Allergy test – waste of time!</li>
  <li>12 September – George given his first training chopsticks!</li>
  <li>26 November – George reached 50 signs!</li>
  <li>03 December – All George’s teeth are now through!</li>
  <li>07 February 2014 – George now weighs 11.7kg and is  82cm tall</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we’re looking forward to another great year discovering who our little man is.</p>

          <title>2013 Year in Review</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/reviews/2013/</link>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>Happy New Year all! As seems to be customary for blog writers, I thought I would do a bit of a year in review for 2013,
so here it is.</p>

<h3 id="achievements">Achievements</h3>

<p>At the start of the year, I officially became a student once again (although I started the course in November last year)
as part of the <a href="//www.leadershipmanagementtraining.org.uk/leadership_for_construction.php" title="20Twenty Leadership for Construction">20Twenty Leadership for Construction</a> programme run by <a href="//www3.cardiffmet.ac.uk/" title="Cardiff Metropolitan University">Cardiff Metropolitan University</a>. I
was somehow stitched up with this through work ;-) . The course consisted of numerous 2 day blocks of teaching across the
year, three essays and culminated in a Strategic Growth Project. I completed it at the beginning of November with good
marks in all my assignments. I have not yet been given the overall final grade, but I have definitely passed so I now have
a Postgraduate Certificate in Sustainable Leadership (Construction) :-) .</p>

<p>At the end of December 2012, George stopped walking whilst he was ill, but by February there was no stopping him and now
he walks, runs, jumps (almost) and climbs on everything. He is great fun. In February, after 5 months of baby signing
classes, George signed his first word, ‘food’ :-) . By the summer he was signing a  small number of things, but from the
middle of September, he really started to progress quickly and now he can sign 56 words! He is also now saying 8 words
clearly :-D . Also,  the last of George’s baby teeth came through in the first week of December so hopefully that’s the
end of teething :-) . He’s growing up so quick!</p>

<p>In April, I made a potentially stupid mistake and signed up for my second half marathon, the <a href="//www.royalparkshalf.com/" title="Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon">Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon</a>
in October. I put in a lot of <a href="/general/50-days-to-go/" title="50 Days to Go">training</a> to make sure I could actually achieve it, I even joined a running club in
September (<a href="//www.caerleonrunningclub.co.uk/" title="Caerleon Running Club">Caerleon Running Club</a>). When the day arrived, I <a href="/general/rpf-half/" title="Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon">completed the race</a> and beat my previous time by
17 minutes finishing in a time of 1:48:10 :-D . After joining the running club, I got more involved in the local running
community and ran my first <a href="//www.parkrun.org.uk/" title="Parkrun">Parkrun</a> at the end of November in a time of 22:01. With all the half marathon training
and club running I managed to complete 500 miles running in 2013. Maybe I’ll aim for 550 miles this year ;-) .</p>

<p>2013 also seemed to be the year for DIY. In May, we finally decided to decorate the walls and beds in the back garden and
put up a fence along the side, and across the drive to pen George in during the summer. So, one weekend, with the help of
Rosie and my dad, we set out and installed a low close board fence. It was great fun, but we didn’t have enough timber to
finish the gate. As such it still isn’t finished :-( . June saw us building a new barbecue next to our garage with some
waste materials from work and in August we built a wall at the end of the steps to finish off the top of the patio. Inside
the house, we decided to brighten the place up with some vinyl stickers and we’re looking forward to doing some more
extensive work this year.</p>

<h3 id="events">Events</h3>

<p>At the end of January we had our traditional Christmas Ham for the Perry Family Christmas which George has managed to see
twice already! Then in February George completed his first full revolution of the sun. We had a selection of party’s for
family and friends (mainly for us, but George seemed to enjoy himself too ;-) ) as well as for Rosie’s birthday so she
didn’t feel left out ;-)</p>

<p>My birthday, once again, coincided with <a href="//scouts.org.uk/reunion/" title="Gilwell Reunion">Gilwell Reunion</a> so we tacked on an extra day to visit <a href="//www.draytonmanor.co.uk/" title="Drayton Manor">Drayton Manor</a>
and <a href="//www.draytonmanor.co.uk/thomas-land.php" title="Thomas Land @ Drayton Manor">Thomas Land</a>. It was another great birthday, and George loved Thomas Land!</p>

<p>We spent Easter in France with friends where we visited <a href="//www.disneylandparis.co.uk/" title="Disneyland Paris">Disneyland</a> and the sights of Paris. It was a brilliant
couple of days, but we tried to fit too much in so it was a bit hectic.</p>

<p>Christmas this year was a little unusual because both sets of our parents were around on the big day :-D . We started the
holiday by visiting Rosie’s Grandparents on the Isle of Wight. We then headed to Basingstoke to visit my sister with my
parents and Gran. We had Christmas at home with my parents visiting in the morning, Rosie’s parents arriving in the
afternoon and all of them joining us for the evening. It was a brilliant day, and although we’ve all got stinking colds
now, we wouldn’t change it for the world!</p>

<h3 id="days-out">Days Out</h3>

<p>After Rosie &amp; George recovered from their late 2012 tummy bug, we began the year by taking George for a walk to the top of
the Sugar Loaf in the Black Mountains. We were joined by Mark for this great start to the year.</p>

<p>At the end of January we were able to officially introduce George to snow, and he loved it. We also picked up National
Trust memberships to encourage us to go on more days out. It was obviously a good incentive as we have been out and about
a lot this year. In August, we got involved with the <a href="//www.gromitunleashed.org.uk/" title="Gromit Unleashed">hunt for Gromit</a> across Bristol giving us several days out
visiting parts of Bristol we may never have gone to otherwise. Here’s a small selection of photos from our adventures :-) .</p>

<h3 id="freerunning">Freerunning</h3>

<p>I also decided to take up a new hobby early in the year and joined Torfaen Freerunning Academy to learn all about
Freerunning &amp; Parkour. The club met weekly at a gym in New Inn so it was great, although they stopped running at the
beginning of August. I had a lot of fun with this gymnastic sport, managing to get a handle on the backflip in April :-) .
I will continue with the freerunning on my own for now, but I have a feeling my progress will be a little slower until
the club restarts or I find another one :-( .</p>

<p>However, 2013 wasn’t all good. In February we discovered that George has a nut allergy, not a major allergy, but an
allergy all the same meaning he has to miss out on some of the best food around!</p>

<p>We also made the tough decision to leave FreeSpirit ESU (the Explorer Scout Unit where we were leaders) after 10 years.
It has been a huge part of our lives for so long, but we felt it was time to move on to spend more time with George.</p>

<p>I may not have improved my Chinese at all since the end of my challenge, but I’ve had a good year and I’m looking forward
to what 2014 brings :-) .</p>

<p>Well I did it! On 06 October 2013 at 10:54 I crossed the line at the end
of my second half marathon. This time it was the <a href="http://www.royalparkshalf.com/" title="Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon">Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon</a> through the
Royal Parks in London, and wow! It was an absolutely stunning route.</p>

<p>We arrived at Hyde Park early on the Sunday morning to find a good portion of the 16,000 runners already
there. The weather was beautiful and I was excited, after all, the route was due to pass the Houses of
Parliament, Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace, as well as running through Hyde Park, Kensington
Gardens, Green Park and St James Park :-D. A warm up was done by <a href="http://www.britmilfit.com/" title="British Military Fitness">British Military Fitness</a> on the
main stage before we were directed into our pens. It was my plan to take it steady due to the issues over
the last 4 weeks with almost no training so I hunted down the 1:50 pacers with the intention of running
with them.</p>

<p>At 09:00 the gun went off and it took me 6 minutes to get to the start line before my race could begin.
We headed off at a steady pace and, as planned, I stuck with the 1:50 pacers. The route was just as
breathtaking as I expected, but what I hadn’t expected was to feel as emotional as I did about it. As I
was running through Admiralty Arch onto the Mall, heading for Buckingham Palace, I felt privileged to be
able to take part in this event through one of my favourite cities!</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Scout runners at the finish" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2246/13106716444_8aa62871d3_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2246/13106716444_8aa62871d3_q.jpg" alt="Scout runners at the finish" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13106716444/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>I was still with the 1:50 pacers as we headed back into Hyde Park and I was feeling quite good. As we
approached the half way mark, I realised that I should be able to run this with a negative split, so I
slightly increased my pace. This took me ahead of the pacers, but I was feeling comfortable and felt I
was quite capable of holding a steady pace. I carried on through the park with very little idea of where
I was in the pack, but I was really enjoying the run so I didn’t really care. At the 800m to go marker I
stepped up the pace again, gradually increasing until I was sprinting across the line in a time of
1:48:10!! It was done :-D and this time, the training I had managed to do brought me to the end of the
race without the need for a stretcher. I actually felt good!</p>

<p>We met up with some of the other Scout runners after the race and then spent the rest of the day exploring
London and playing in the park with George. It was a fantastic day, and the nicest run I have ever been
on :-).</p>

<p>As I am sure most people that know me are aware, I am running the 
<a href="http://royalparkshalf.com" title="Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon">Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon</a> to raise money for the <a href="http://scouts.org.uk/" title="The Scout Association">Scout Association</a>. Well,
there are now only 50 days to go to race day so I thought I would do a bit of a write up to try
and drum up some more support.</p>

<h3 id="why-am-i-running">Why Am I Running?</h3>

<p>I got an email from the <a href="http://scouts.org.uk/" title="The Scout Association">Scouts</a> describing a number of <a href="http://scouts.org.uk/challengeevents/" title="Scouts Challenge Events">Challenge Events</a> that were
running, and for which they needed volunteers. Well, I quite enjoy running so when I saw the
<a href="http://royalparkshalf.com" title="Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon">RPF Half Marathon</a>, I thought why not. Now although that was my first reason for running,
the main reason is obviously to raise money to support the Scouts.</p>

<p>I have been a Scout at various stages since I was 8 years old, 10 years as a youth member and 10
years as a leader. I’ve had some wonderful opportunities through Scouts over the years, and have
seen many young people really develop since becoming a leader. It is an organisation that I am
proud to be a part of, and I believe the benefits that the organisation brings to young people
are huge.</p>

<p>Since becoming a Scout I have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trekked across the Central River Division of The Gambia as part of a 3 man team (amongst a
much larger team);</li>
  <li>Participated in 3 International Jamborees (EuroJam 2005, Serbian Jamboree 2006 &amp; World Scout
Jamboree 2007) where I met people from all corners of the globe;</li>
  <li>Woken up under a clear sky in the middle of the Mafikeng Safari Park, South Africa on the 1
January 2007 (the Centenary year of Scouts at the birthplace of Scouting);</li>
  <li>Spent time with <a href="http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/trips/scouts/threenations09/mongolia-day-2/" title="Three Nations Expedition - Nomads on the Plains of Mongolia">Nomads on the Plains of Mongolia</a>;</li>
  <li>Visited the [Terracotta Army in Xi’an, China][xian] and the <a href="http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/trips/scouts/threenations09/the-sites-of-beijing/" title="Three Nations Expedition - Forbidden City in Beijing, China">Forbidden City in Beijing, China</a>;</li>
  <li>As well as endless nights camping, days hiking, kayaking, climbing and learning all sorts of
new skills, that have helped me become who I am today, right here in the UK.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is due to the dedication of volunteers across the country that I have had the opportunity to
experience what I have, but there is also an awful lot of support needed from Scouts as a whole
to make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-the-money-be-used-for">What will the Money be Used For?</h3>

<p>All the money raised by myself, and everyone else participating in these challenge events, will be
used to support the formation of new groups across the country to give more young people the
opportunities that myself, and many others, have had.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-you-sponsor-me">How Can You Sponsor Me?</h3>

<p>If you would like to sponsor me then you can do so by any of the following means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/richardpperry/" title="JustGiving Donation Page">http://www.justgiving.com/richardpperry</a></li>
  <li>Text “<strong>SCOU74 £2</strong>” or “<strong>SCOU74 £5</strong>” or “<strong>SCOU74 £10</strong>” etc to <strong>70070</strong></li>
  <li>Or by just giving me money and signing a form if you prefer :-)</li>
</ol>

<p>And for those of you that have already kindly sponsored me, thank you very much :-)</p>

    <p>Since mid March, I have been going to Torfaen Freerunning Academy at the Torfaen Academy of Gymnastics in New Inn. I’ve
been quite interested in the concept of Parkour/Freerunning for a while so I thought it would be fun. Although I am quite
a bit older than the vast majority of the people there, I have been welcomed and supported brilliantly since I joined. I
have been working on vaults and flips from the start and on 26 April, I completed my first unsupported backflip :-D. So
here’s the video (granted this was taken the following week when I had cleaned it up a bit).</p>

          <title>My Epic Quest</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/general/challenges/epic/my-epic-quest/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2013 16:49:58 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Richard Perry (richard@perrymail.me.uk)</author>
          <guid>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/general/challenges/epic/my-epic-quest/</guid>
          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>(<em>This post has been inspired by Steve Kamb at <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/epic-quest/">Nerd Fitness</a></em>)</p>

<p>I recently read an article on <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/epic-quest/">Nerd Fitness</a> where
Steve Kamb had set out his goals for “levelling up” his life. He used the metaphor of Role Playing
Games to make the concept manageable and put together a list of challenges or quests that could be
completed to advance from one level to the next. He then decided that each quest would be worth 20%
experience towards the next level, there would also be Master Quests that equated to 100% experience,
and this became his ‘Epic Quest of Awesome’. I thought this was a pretty good idea, so using the
same concept, I have come up with my own Epic Quest. It’s no different to a bucket list that many
people have, but it just sounds cooler ;-).</p>

<p>I’ve been very lucky over the last few years so I’ve already done a lot of the things I would have
added to this list. So here it is. Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>George is now a year old so I thought it might be
time for a bit of reflection on how the first year has gone :-). For Rosie &amp; I
it has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride, but I think we’ve been very lucky.
George has generally been good as gold since the day he was born. Don’t get me
wrong, he cries, screams and tests the boundaries just like any other kid, but
I think we may have had things a little easier than most.  Most of the time he
seems to be contented and happy, but he is definitely learning the art of crying
for attention! We’ll have to keep that one in check I think. George also seems to
be developing physically very fast. Granted he is short (but who does that
surprise with Rosie &amp; I for parents!!) but he went from being a generally
stationary baby to walking in no time at all! It’s brilliant to see the
progression and I am really enjoying the fact he is so mobile most of the time,
although sometimes it would be nice if he would stay put for longer than 1
second! Here is a list of the milestones he has reached in his first 12 months.</p>

<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>

<ul>
  <li>07 February 2012 - George was born :-D at 13:47 weighing 3.48kg (7lb 11oz)</li>
  <li>09 - 12 April 2012 - First holiday (Cornwall)</li>
  <li>08 May 2012 - First laughed</li>
  <li>25 May 2012 - First night camping (Portcullis Camp)</li>
  <li>01 June 2012 - First flight (to Jersey)</li>
  <li>09 June 2012 - First sat up</li>
  <li>July 2012 - First walked with help</li>
  <li>18 July 2012 - First sat unaided</li>
  <li>19 July 2012 - First tooth</li>
  <li>21 July 2012 - First crawled</li>
  <li>29 September 2012 - First stood unaided</li>
  <li>23 December 2012 - First walked alone</li>
</ul>

<p>We are still really enjoying being parents, even with the occasional sleepless
night, public temper tantrum etc. I am extremely glad I made the decision to move
to my <a href="/general/a-new-start/">new job</a> because it has meant I
have been able to spend a lot more time with George than I would have done
otherwise. It’s been a great year and I’m thoroughly looking forward to what this
year will bring :-D.</p>

          <title>Mandarin Progress Month 4</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/languages/mandarin/month-4/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2013 15:25:33 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Richard Perry (richard@perrymail.me.uk)</author>
          <guid>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/languages/mandarin/month-4/</guid>
          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>So my 4 months are up and unfortunately, the last 2 months have been a bit useless for various
reasons, so needless to say I haven’t really managed to achieve my goal. Over the last month I have
probably only spent about 10 hours learning Mandarin, and the bulk of that was probably reviewing
characters on <a href="http://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a>. I have still not yet completed all 30 lessons from
<a href="http://www.pimsleur.com/Learn-Mandarin-Chinese">Pimsleurs</a> Mandarin 1 so that is still on my todo
list.</p>

<p>I have improved by reading comprehension and my speaking a little, but I don’t think I would be able
to hold a 5 minute conversation yet. Ah well. I have enjoyed it and so I will continue to plod on at
my previous pace and see how it goes. Even though I haven’t achieved what I set out to, I still
think it was a worthwhile experiment and I will continue to set targets for future learning in the
hope that some day I do manage to learn Mandarin to a conversational level. With that in mind, here
are my goals for 2013:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish <a href="http://www.pimsleur.com/Learn-Mandarin-Chinese">Pimsleurs</a> Mandarin 1 (yes it’s still here, I’ve got to do it someday!);</li>
  <li>Increase my character knowledge to 1,500 characters;</li>
  <li>Make use of <a href="http://www.verbling.com/">Verbling</a> (a new service for having short conversations with native speakers) to improve my spoken Mandarin.</li>
</ul>

<p>So nothing over the top, but hopefully they’re achievable.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>It has now been 3 months since I started my Mandarin Language Challenge so it’s time for another
update. This month has been very slow going and I have achieved pretty much nothing. I started the
month with the intention of reviewing all the Pimsleur lesson I had learned so far and reciting the
conversations from each lesson as SoundCloud items. However, it wasn’t until 15 November that I
uploaded the first two lessons, and then I haven’t continued since. I have therefore decided to
pretend that November didn’t happen and try to continue from where I left off at the end of October
with the same goals etc. carrying forward to December.</p>

<p>For those that are interested, here is the only audio clip I have uploaded in the last month:</p>

          <title>Mandarin Progress Month 2</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/languages/mandarin/month-2/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 20:31:15 +0000</pubDate>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>We are now into the third month of my Mandarin Chinese language challenge, so here is an update to
how month 2 has gone. Lets start by updating you on my targets from last month.</p>

<h3 id="practice-more-than-twice-a-week">1. Practice more than twice a week</h3>

<p>This time I think I just about managed to practice more than twice a week, although still not as
much as I would have liked.</p>

<h3 id="publish-at-least-one-journal-entry-tolang-8httplang-8comper-week">2. Publish at least one journal entry to <a href="http://lang-8.com/">Lang-8</a> per week</h3>

<p>The Lang-8 community are very helpful and I have been inundated with corrections when I have
actually submitted an entry, but I did not manage to achieve the requisite on entry per week this
month, maybe I will manage it next month. These are my entries for October for anyone that is
interested.</p>

<h4 id="week-1---about-mehttplang-8com280403journals171081125e5258525b325e425ba258e25e625882591"><a href="http://lang-8.com/280403/journals/1710811/%25E5%2585%25B3%25E4%25BA%258E%25E6%2588%2591">Week 1 - 关于我 / About Me</a></h4>

<p>我住在一个小城镇叫Pontypool。它是在威尔士南部。
我住跟我的太太和儿子一起。我的儿子是八个月大。
我是一个童军领袖。 我享受攀岩，皮划艇和步行。</p>

<p>I live in a small town called Pontypool. It is in South Wales.
I live with my wife and son. My son is eight months old.
I am a Scout Leader. I enjoy climbing, kayaking and walking.</p>

<h4 id="week-3----family-day-outhttplang-8com280403journals174066225e525ae25b625e525ba25ad25e7259a258425e425b8258025e525a425a9"><a href="http://lang-8.com/280403/journals/1740662/%25E5%25AE%25B6%25E5%25BA%25AD%25E7%259A%2584%25E4%25B8%2580%25E5%25A4%25A9">Week 3 - 家庭的一天 / Family Day Out</a></h4>

<p>昨天我的太太，我的儿子和我去看看在 Bristol 动物园的 恐龙。我们也看看企鹅，灰沼狸和猴。我们有一个非常愉快的一天，
George 也有乐趣。我们吃晚饭在McDonald’s。</p>

<p>Yesterday my wife, my son and I went to Bristol Zoo to see the dinosaurs. We also saw the penguins,
meerkats &amp; monkeys. We had a very nice day and George had fun too. We had dinner at McDonald’s.</p>

<p>And I’m afraid that’s it for this month!</p>

<h3 id="publish-at-least-two-audio-clips-tosoundcloudhttpsoundcloudcom">3. Publish at least two audio clips to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a></h3>

<p>So I planned to record at least two audio clips to put up on Soundcloud during October, and it was
very touch and go, but I just about managed it. The first clip was a basic introduction/about me
discussion that was scripted (and corrected via <a href="http://lang-8.com/">Lang-8</a>), although I didn’t
practice it so it was quite disjointed. Hopefully it wasn’t too bad in terms of the Mandarin usage,
but I haven’t had any comments so maybe this platform isn’t going to be the best way forward. I’ll
give it a bit more time before making that decision though.</p>

<h4 id="about-me">关于我 About Me</h4>

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/63535536&amp;color=0066cc&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe>

<p>My second clip was a recitation of a lullaby sung by Jackie Chan in the Spy Next Door (quite a funny
film as it happens). I thought it sounded very gentle so I am now learning it to sing to George.
This is the level I am at with it at the moment (this was read from a script as I can’t remember
the words just yet :-)).</p>

<h4 id="ba-ma-de-hua">Ba Ma De Hua</h4>

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/65572317&amp;color=0066cc&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe>

<p>So both clips this month are a little disjointed, slow and hard to listen to, but it’s a start. I am
aiming to do a lot more of this in future to improve the flow of my speaking. All in all I’m quite
pleased so far.</p>

<h3 id="learn-at-least-200-new-characters-usingmemrisehttpwwwmemrisecom">4. Learn at least 200 new characters using <a href="http://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a></h3>

<p>I tried really hard with this this month, but I missed a few days in the middle and have been trying
to catch up every since. Still, I managed to get through nearly 150 new characters so I’m more than
happy with that.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>As I suspected, it still wasn’t a brilliant month for progress, but I think I’m definitely getting
better so I am much happier than I was at the end of September. Instead of looking back at how I did
this month, I am going to look forward to what I aim to do next month :-).</p>

<h4 id="plans-for-november">Plans for November</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Learn another 150 characters using <a href="http://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a>;</li>
  <li>Publish at least three audio clips to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a>;</li>
  <li>At least learn the words to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/richardpperry/ba-ma-de-hua">Ba Ma De Hua</a> by heart;</li>

<p>This year, my birthday landed on Gilwell Reunion weekend so Rosie decided to put together an amazing weekend based at Gilwell Park. Gilwell Reunion is a weekend for Scout Leaders that doesn’t involve bringing along any Scouts so it’s a brilliant chill out weekend where we get to catch up with friends from all over the world that we’ve met on various events, so it’s always nice when it lands on my birthday. This year, Rosie also arranged for us to take a trip into London on Saturday to watch some wheelchair fencing at the ExCeL Centre.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Me &amp; George Outside the North Greenwich Arena" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7336/13058528134_6eb75749de_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7336/13058528134_6eb75749de_q.jpg" alt="Me &amp; George Outside the North Greenwich Arena" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058528134/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>We arrived late on the Friday night for various reasons, and headed out early on Saturday morning to get into London, so we didn’t really take part in Friday night or Saturday at Reunion, but the Paralympic Games more than made up for this. Our session was due to start at 11:00 at the ExCeL Centre so we took a scenic route to get there. We got the tube through to the <del>O2</del> North Greenwich Arena so that we could take the Emirates Air Line across to ExCeL. Thankfully the weather was great so we could see for miles all the way across east London. The views were incredible, and if you haven’t already had a chance to go on it, then you really should. It only lasts for a bit more than 5 minutes, but it’s well worth it! We arrived at the ExCeL with plenty of time to spare so I took the opportunity to give Rosie &amp; George the tour of the place I spent the two weeks of the Olympics (although I couldn’t get everywhere because, apparently, my accreditation was only valid for the Olympics!). &lt;div class='flickr image alignleft'&gt;<span><a title="Hong Kong Smashing Great Britain in Wheelchair Fencing" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3726/13058543074_bdd26a0687_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3726/13058543074_bdd26a0687_q.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Smashing Great Britain in Wheelchair Fencing" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058543074/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span>&lt;/div&gt;We also realised that the tickets we had were day passes so we were able to watch anything that had spare seats :-). As our tickets were for the wheelchair fencing first &amp; foremost, that was where we began our day. The quarter finals of the men’s team event was on, and GBR were fighting Hong Kong. It seems that Hong Kong are ridiculously good in comparison to GBR, so we watched our guys getting knocked out (45 - 19). The way the competitors moved, bearing in mind their wheelchairs were locked in place, was pretty incredible. I enjoyed the Olympic Fencing, but the Paralympic fencing was far more exciting and appeared a lot more difficult. One thing I wasn’t expecting though, was some of the competitors being able to walk!</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Wheelchair Table Tennis" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7347/13058353893_33c70ee3c0_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7347/13058353893_33c70ee3c0_q.jpg" alt="Wheelchair Table Tennis" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058353893/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The next stop was the Table Tennis. We had no idea what category/stage was taking place, so it was quite good to find it was the Category 4-5 (wheelchair) team medal matches. Again, the wheelchairs were not even a slight hindrance to these guys, they were bouncing the chairs left and right to reach the ball as if it was the most natural thing in the world. The entire thing seemed effortless to them. The games were also just as fast paced as the Olympic table tennis, which I (ashamedly) didn’t expect because of the perceived difficulty moving back and forth along the table edge. The whole thing was a real eye opener for me. Olympians are always praised for the effort and skill involved in reaching the peak of their discipline, but Paralympians never seem to get the same recognition. In my humble opinion, the Paralympians deserve to be recognised in exactly the same way because they show the world that the word ‘disabled’ is simply a matter of mind. They are all less able, in one way or another, than somebody else, but their so-called ‘disabilities’ do not stop them from living their life the same as everyone else. It seems to me that ‘disabled’ is a moniker that can only really be applied to those that have given up, or believe that their disability defines them.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="The three of us with Wenlock &amp; Mandeville" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3771/13058539504_92cefd6b04_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3771/13058539504_92cefd6b04_q.jpg" alt="The three of us with Wenlock &amp; Mandeville" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058539504/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>Before heading back to Gilwell Reunion, we decided to check out the view over the Olympic Park from the viewing gallery at John Lewis at the Westfield Centre. This was perhaps one of our less well-considered ideas. We had to fight against the hoards of people thronging through the shopping centre before joining the queue to get to the viewing gallery. When we finally got there, the view was less than fantastic. I can’t argue against the description, it was actually a view of the whole park, but it wasn’t looking down over the park so it was very difficult to actually see anything. Nevermind, the money was for charity so it doesn’t matter really.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Georges First Gilwell Reunion Campfire" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7407/13058350893_fafba37d28_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7407/13058350893_fafba37d28_q.jpg" alt="Georges First Gilwell Reunion Campfire" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058350893/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>We got back to site in time to have a quick dinner of fish &amp; chips before wandering over to the Gilwell Camp Fire. It wasn’t George’s first campfire, but it was his first Gilwell Reunion campfire and they do things a little differently here. Unfortunately, he was so tired from the day that he didn’t really enjoy it and so Rosie &amp; I spent some time trying to get him to settle away from it all. We had to take him straight to bed when we got back to the tent and so decided to retire ourselves.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="George with the UKCC Wayne Bulpitt" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7378/13058536064_f2b2a06104_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7378/13058536064_f2b2a06104_q.jpg" alt="George with the UKCC Wayne Bulpitt" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058536064/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The next day we were able to take part in Gilwell Reunion, so we strolled around the various stalls around the site and caught up with friends from all over the place. George even got to meet Wayne Bulpitt. I do enjoy Gilwell, even if it is a little overpriced. This year we were even able to stay for the AGM and have a nice chilled out day because we were planning on staying in London another night. We stayed in Chingford to have dinner with Mark before heading to the hotel closer to Watford, but just as we were leaving site we got a phone call from the hotel telling us that our booking had been transferred due to an incident at the hotel. Lucky we hadn’t already left then really! We reprogrammed our sat nav and found our way to the other hotel with no problems.</p>

Studio Tour Entrance" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058534164/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The last part of my birthday weekend was a visit to the <a href="http://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/">Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter</a> so, after our usual leisurely breakfast, we checked out of the hotel and made our way to the studios ready for our preallocated entrance time of 10:30. Unfortunately we arrived at the same time as a bus full of school kids! This seemed like an ideal time to make sure George had a clean nappy and wasn’t hungry.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="The Cupboard Under the Stairs" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3250/13058218035_203698822e_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3250/13058218035_203698822e_q.jpg" alt="The Cupboard Under the Stairs" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058218035/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The tour began with a the obligatory queue when we got to see the Cupboard Under the Stairs and Rosie managed to get me a birthday badge. We were ushered into a small room that had videos on each wall introducing how Harry Potter was chosen to become the next franchise, and then into an auditorium. This was where the tour really began, with an introduction to the Studio Tour by one of the staff, and then by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (on video of course). Once this finished the screen lifted up to reveal the actual doors to the Great Hall! What a brilliant way to open!</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Rosie &amp; George at the Entrance to the Great Hall" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3193/13058216495_bf874fcd7c_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3193/13058216495_bf874fcd7c_q.jpg" alt="Rosie &amp; George at the Entrance to the Great Hall" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058216495/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>For the next few hours, we walked around Studio J (the home of the various sets, props costumes etc) taking in the enormity of the task to create the world of Harry Potter, ably guided by Tom Felton aka Dracy Malfoy via an audio/video guide (basically an iPod Touch in a custom case with a custom app running on it). We got to see the table decorations from the Yule Ball, the Mirror of Erised, the Goblet of Fire, the Triwizard Cup, the trunk that held Alastor Moody, the vanishing cabinet, the Death Eater masks, thousands of wands, junk from the Room of Requirement, the horcruxes, the portraits, the Great Hall, Dumbledores Office, the Gryffindor Common Room &amp; bedroom, Hagrids Hut, the Burrow kitchen and so much more. I was like a kid in a candy shop! It really was brilliant to see how, and to what level of detail, it was all built.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Rosie on the Knight Bus" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2761/13058342653_b8565a26a6_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2761/13058342653_b8565a26a6_q.jpg" alt="Rosie on the Knight Bus" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058342653/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>After leaving Studio J, we moved out to the back lot where we got to try Butterbeer (not entirely convinced on this one, probably an acquired taste) and had lunch. The back lot is where a lot of the bigger props and sets are located including the Knight Bus (yes that’s right, it really exists and wasn’t just done with CGI), Sirius Blacks motorbike, the Ford Anglia, Tom Riddles gravestone, 4 Privet Drive, the Potter house from Godric’s Hollow, the bridge and the full size wizards chess pieces. This was brilliant, but the fact that you could actually get one the Knight Bus, Sirius Blacks motorbike and the Ford Anglia just made it that much better. Also, they’ve recently opened up the bridge to visitors so we got to cross that as well!</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Goblin Heads in Creature Effects" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/13058568794_6d034388d1_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/13058568794_6d034388d1_q.jpg" alt="Goblin Heads in Creature Effects" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058568794/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>I really was having an amazing day at this point, and we still had the creature workshop and the models to go :-). Just as the rain started coming down we moved on to Studio K. On entering the first room of the creature workshop, we were confronted by shelf upon shelf of goblin heads. This led on to a number of workbenches with various prosthetics and models on display in various states of completeness. This was also where we came across an animatronic Hagrid! It turns out that for some of the scenes it was necessary to use this model because of how big Hagrid is meant to be. In the centre of the room, they also had a display of a Fawkes, Mandrake, Hedwig &amp; dying Voldemort models that were hooked up to buttons so you could see them working.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Buckbeak" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3526/13058567234_4ef8bafd49_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3526/13058567234_4ef8bafd49_q.jpg" alt="Buckbeak" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058567234/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The main creature effects workshop area then leads into an area displaying some of the larger creatures including the Basilisk (both the living one and the skeleton), a Thestral, a dragon, Buckbeak and Aragog, and they really were big!</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Diagon Alley" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2605/13058377913_c500f000f2_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2605/13058377913_c500f000f2_q.jpg" alt="Diagon Alley" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058377913/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>We then found ourselves in the real Diagon Alley set, complete with Ollivanders, Eyelops, Flourish &amp; Blotts, Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and Gringotts to name a few. This was the actual set used for all the films where Diagon Alley appeared, and if it wasn’t for the walkway that had been installed in the centre, this would have been a ‘hot’ set (i.e. ready for filming), which I thought was pretty cool. There was even a moving broomstick in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="The Art Department" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7320/13058375393_5caf61fce3_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7320/13058375393_5caf61fce3_q.jpg" alt="The Art Department" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058375393/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>At this point I thought we were nearing the end with only the main Hogwarts model to go. How wrong could I be! We still had the art department to visit. This was one of the most amazing parts of the tour for me because it really gave an idea of how difficult it is to actually build a realistic looking set, and what steps need to be taken before any actual construction takes place. It seemed to me that it would be more difficult to build a realistic looking set for a film like Harry Potter than to build a landmark building in the real world!</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="The Burrow Model" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3484/13058246275_627ede716e_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3484/13058246275_627ede716e_q.jpg" alt="The Burrow Model" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058246275/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>In this section there were endless technical drawings plastered over the high walls (reminiscent of my last site office at BAM) with shelves full of box files, and architectural models of absolutely everything. Not only was all this stuff on display for the public, but nobody had any issues with you taking pictures of whatever you liked. There were also various different artists impressions of sets, characters and scenes on display along the walls of one of the corridors, and these were absolutely stunning! Unfortunately, very few of them were available to buy.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="1:24 Scale Model of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7326/13058383143_da0ccdb5f6_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7326/13058383143_da0ccdb5f6_q.jpg" alt="1:24 Scale Model of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13058383143/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>Then came the pièce de résistance, the 1:24 scale model of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry  It was, in a word, breathtaking. The sheer scale of the thing was incredible! The room that housed the model was set up with a descending ramp that wrapped all the way around the model so you could get the full impression of the structure. They had programmed the lighting to cycle through day and night on a fairly regular basis as well, so you could see the building in all its glory at various times of artificial day. Around the edges were interactive info panels that showed how they used the model when filming the exterior scenes for the movie. There were fly throughs that started in the model, then transitioned through to the post processed imagery giving a really good impression of how it all worked.</p>

<p>Well after an impressive 5½ hours, we were done and visiting the gift shop. I can’t quite believe we were in there for that long, especially given that neither of us felt that it had dragged, or was taking too long. I think I could have spent more time in Studio J, but otherwise I think it was just right. We had a brilliant time and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is into Harry Potter or has aspirations to get into film making/set building etc.</p>

<p>Thank you Rosie for a fantastic weekend!</p>

          <title>Mandarin Progress Month 1</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/languages/mandarin/month-1/</link>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>It has now been a month since I started my Mandarin Chinese language challenge, so I think it’s time for an update on how I’m doing. To be honest, it’s not being going all that well. The first week went quite well, I was generally following my study plan (except for some evening sessions), but then it became unworkable. I guess I didn’t really plan it well enough, so I have amended the plan in an attempt to make it easier to follow without reducing the commitment needed. Well, it still isn’t really working. Here is a summary of the key points from this month.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I do listen to Mandarin radio most of the day in work;</li>
  <li>I have kept up with my vocabulary on <a href="http://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a> (up to over 400 words now, although I did start that earlier this year).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-bad"> The Bad</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I haven’t been working on my Mandarin every day;</li>
  <li>I still haven’t spoken to anyone yet (other than George &amp; myself);</li>
  <li>I haven’t put much on my new Mandarin <a href="http://twitter.com/richard_p2_ZH">Twitter</a> account yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally my commitment over the last month has been fairly poor for various reasons, but mainly because I am enjoying spending time with my son when I get home and by the time he goes to bed and we’ve eaten, I don’t feel like doing anything else. This is definitely not the right attitude if I want to improve so I am going to try to do better this month.</p>

<p>I will upload a video or audio clip of me speaking Mandarin in the next couple of days to show the progress I have/haven’t made.</p>

<h3 id="plans-for-october">Plans for October</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Practice more than twice a week;</li>
  <li>Publish at least one journal entry to <a href="http://lang-8.com">Lang-8</a> per week;</li>
  <li>Publish at least two audio clips to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a>;</li>
  <li>Learn at least 200 new characters using <a href="http://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <p>This is my favourite photo from our week in Scotland with
<a href="http://freespiritesu.org.uk/campdiaries/lochgoilhead2012/">FreeSpirit ESU</a>.
Three of the leaders (&amp; George) decided to take a trip over to Inverary, mainly
to visit <a href="http://www.lfw.co.uk/">Loch Fyne Whiskies</a> (supposedly the “finest
whiskey retailer in the world”), but also to see the area. As we stood looking
out over the harbour, this was the view. It was absolutely stunning and I really
think this photo has captured the scene so it’s one I’m really proud of :-) !!</p>

          <title>My Language Challenge</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/languages/mandarin/language-challenge/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 19:42:55 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Richard Perry (richard@perrymail.me.uk)</author>
          <guid>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/languages/mandarin/language-challenge/</guid>
          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>Since early 2009 I have been learning Mandarin Chinese off and on. This may seem an odd language to choose so let me explain. In 2007 a good friend of ours told us about a Scouting trip he was organising to Russia, Mongolia &amp; China (further details available <a href="http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/trips/china-2009/" title="Three Nations &amp; China 2009">here</a>. This seemed like a good idea at the time, and, to cut a long story short, Rosie &amp; I decided to stay on in China for a further 5 weeks. The time we spent in China was absolutely amazing and I gained a real appreciation for the country, the culture and the language and I wanted to learn more.  I decided to learn the language to better understand the culture. Since then, it seems that my language learning has taken a bit of a back seat, with endless excuses rationalising why, so I have resolved to set up a language challenge to try to encourage me to get on with it!</p>

<p>The inspiration for this challenge came from Benny at <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/" title="Fluent in 3 Months">Fluent in 3 Months</a>. At the start of this year he set out on his lofty goal of becoming fluent in Mandarin in 3 months. Although fluency wasn’t necessarily achieved in this time, he appears very comfortable conversing in Mandarin and this really has helped to spur me on. It was Benny who suggested that people should try their own <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/fi3m-challenge/" title="3 month challenge">3 month challenge</a> over the summer, and although I’m a little late to the party (and adding a month) I am going to go for it :-). The challenge will run from 01 September 2012 until 31 December 2012 and the goals for this challenge are to be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read 1,000 Chinese characters;</li>
  <li>have a simple 5 minute conversation with a Chinese speaker (probably via Skype);</li>
  <li>write simple sentences in Chinese, i.e. to Tweet in Chinese.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all leading towards my long-term goals of being able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand a film in Chinese;</li>
  <li>read a book in Chinese;</li>
  <li>converse confidently with Chinese speakers;</li>
  <li>teach my son rudimentary (at least) Mandarin.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this first language challenge, I am going to use the following resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.chinabooks.com/home.php?cat=319" title="New Practical Chinese Reader">New Practical Chinese Reader</a>  by Beijing Language &amp; Culture University Press (I picked this up in Chengdu in 2009);	</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415434157/" title="Colloquial Chinese">Colloquial Chinese</a> by Qian Kan;	</li>
  <li><a href="http://memrise.com/" title="Memrise">Memrise</a> to learn the characters;	</li>
  <li><a href="http://chinesepod.com/" title="ChinesePod">ChinesePod</a> for listening practice and to help learn sentence structures, grammar etc;	</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pimsleur.com/Learn-Mandarin-Chinese" title="Learn Mandarin Chinese with The Pimsleur Method">Learn Mandarin Chinese with The Pimsleur Method</a> for speaking &amp; listening;	</li>
  <li><a href="mms://media.ccdntech.com/wmtencoder/rti/cbs2.wmv" title="Chinese Radio">Chinese Radio</a> for real life listening practice;	</li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/richard_p2_ZH" title="Richard Perry Chinese Language Twitter Account">Twitter</a> for writing simple sentences regularly (new Chinese only Twitter account);	</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.skype.com/" title="Skype">Skype</a> for Language Exchanges;	</li>
  <li>Any other suggestions would be gratefully received :-).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is going to need some serious commitment on my part, which has been a problem in the past. The main reason for this, I believe, is a lack of focus so I am going to put together a simple, flexible study planner allocating time slots to reading, writing, listening, speaking &amp; vocabulary work. It may take a while to get the balance right, but I think that combining time slots and a medium term challenge, I may actually achieve something tangible this time. I will try to track my progress with semi-regular updates on this blog.</p>

<p>Wish me luck :-P.</p>

          <title>Life as a Games Maker</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>Over the last two weeks or so, you may have been aware of a small sporting event taking place mainly
in London known as the Olympic Games. Well I volunteered to work at the Games and was fortunate enough
to be accepted as one of the 70,000 Games Makers who would be a huge part of making the Games happen.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Blackheath Rugby Club on a Misty Morning" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7436/12971260605_e434f08f73_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7436/12971260605_e434f08f73_q.jpg" alt="Blackheath Rugby Club on a Misty Morning" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971260605/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>My Games began on Monday 30 July so I was able to watch the 
opening ceremony from the comfort of my own sofa  :-). I left for London on the afternoon of 29 July
to make my new home at <a href="http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/blackheath/" title="Blackheath Rugby Club">Blackheath Rugby Club</a> courtesy of <a href="http://www.campingninja.com/" title="Camping Ninja">Camping Ninja</a>. Check In was
relatively simple so once my tent was up I was able to get an early night ready for my first day at
the <a href="http://www.excel-london.co.uk/" title="ExCeL Centre">ExCeL Centre</a>.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="ExCeL Last Mile Zone Hub 20" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2894/12971211095_7e121f0e04_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2894/12971211095_7e121f0e04_q.jpg" alt="ExCeL Last Mile Zone Hub 20" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971211095/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>My first three days were morning shifts starting at the area known as
the Hub (i.e. the main hive of activity between Custom House DLR Station and the main entrance to
the ExCeL Centre). After meeting up with a number of other new Games Makers and being issued our pink
hi-vis vests, we were ready to start. My role basically involved smiling a lot, assist the signage in
directing spectators to the main entrance and answering any and all questions asked to the best of my
ability. Now I’m not really too familiar with the Docklands area of London, but after endless
questions along the lines of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where do I find …;</li>
  <li>How do I get to …;</li>
  <li>Is there a … near here etc.</li>
</ul>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Fencing (Sabre) Quarter Finals" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7450/12971279915_1e993a2e16_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7450/12971279915_1e993a2e16_q.jpg" alt="Fencing (Sabre) Quarter Finals" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971279915/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>I began to get acquainted with the area fairly quickly. As much
as it seems this would be a very boring experience, it was far from it. In the first three days, I met
people from all over the world who were extremely excited and enthusiastic about the Olympic Games.
Working among that level of excitement and enthusiasm makes it very difficult for anyone to be bored, we
even got the opportunity to ‘borrow’ some empty seats in the fencing arena after shift one day ;-). At
the end of my first three days, I was quite tired but I did have an amazing time :-).</p>

<p>My first day off brought me back to Wales to visit Rosie &amp; George and to chill out a bit. It was great
to see them both again, but I was soon on my way back to London for my next three days. This time I was
on afternoon shifts so I decided to make the most of the extra time I had by visiting the ExCeL centre
to watch more of the events taking place there (and maybe get a sneaky extra meal voucher for lunch to
save some cash ;-))</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="The Leaky Cauldron (believe it or not)" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7299/12971689204_3060afd08e_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7299/12971689204_3060afd08e_q.jpg" alt="The Leaky Cauldron (believe it or not)" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971689204/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>I spent my next day off in London on my own, so, bearing in mind I  had
no chance of getting into the Olympic Park, I decided to go hunting Harry Potter filming locations in
central London (it also meant I got to make full use of my Games Maker Oyster Card :-P). I also tried
to get into Hyde Park to watch some of the Games on the big screen, but the rain put me off a bit.</p>

<p>The second week continued in much the same vein as the last, standing on various street corners directing,
chatting and laughing with people from all over the world… so it was obviously brilliant! I managed to
confuse some Mongolians by greeting them in Mongolian, followed by telling the story of our
<a href="http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/trips/china-2009/" title="China &amp; Mongolia 2009">wild adventures</a> in Mongolia. The best thing about being able to greet people in their own language 
had to be the looks on their faces when they realise what you have said. It’s certainly a good conversation 
starter ;-) (even if that conversation does take place in English).</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="George &amp; I Hanging Around" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7401/12971669154_255068b3d0_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7401/12971669154_255068b3d0_q.jpg" alt="George &amp; I Hanging Around" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971669154/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>Rosie and George joined me in London for my last three days meaning
I got to move out of the tent and into a hotel :-). We visited Kew Gardens on my day off, but it wasn’t as
relaxing as I’d hoped. Unfortunately all this standing around for hours and hours every day was starting to
take a toll on the soles of my feet so I was starting to suffer a bit by the end of the day.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Last Mile Team Excel Celebrating the End of a Great 2 Weeks" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7441/12971655604_8373488965_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7441/12971655604_8373488965_q.jpg" alt="Last Mile Team Excel Celebrating the End of a Great 2 Weeks" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971655604/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The whole experience was absolutely magical and from the moment I started,
right to the end, I was having a good time (yes, even the slow times at the boring locations) and I am
immensely proud to have been involved! It was a fantastic experience and I am very glad I was a part of
the London 2012 Olympic Games, although I now wish I could help out at the Paralympic Games as well. It
certainly helps that I was able to see a fair bit of sport from some tidy ‘borrowed’ seats in the ExCeL
Centre itself :-).</p>

<p class="aligncentre">So who’s up for Rio 2016? Only kidding (I think)</p>

    <div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="London 2012" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7297/12971257513_98311c1276_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7297/12971257513_98311c1276_q.jpg" alt="London 2012" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971257513/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>So the time is nearly here for me to leave to help at the Olympic Games.
I thought it was about time I wrote something about the last 2 years leading up to it.</p>

<p>My journey began on 15 September 2010 when the London 2012 Games Maker application process opened to
the public. I didn’t have a clue what would be involved, but it seemed to me to be a once in a lifetime
opportunity so, after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, I decided to apply to be a Games Maker at the London
2012 Olympic Games. It was at this point that things became very quiet, although we were warned this
would be the case.</p>

<p>The next stage came just after Easter 2011 when I was invited to a Games Maker Selection Event on 16
June 2011. This was to be in Cardiff so it was nice and easy to get to. I arrived a little early to make
sure I didn’t miss anything and was ushered into the waiting area. The whole process was very well
organised, and very efficient. We passed through a number of small areas where we got to see how the
Games Makers came about, what it is they do (which is pretty much everything) and how things would
progress from here. Once we were through all this, we were called up for interview with somebody
representing LOCOG. This was one of the most relaxed interviews I have every had. I spent most of the
time talking about the things I’ve done in Scouting, and what I am now involved in and that was it, the
interview was over and we all filed out through the London 2012 merchandise shop before heading home.</p>

<p>Apparently I came across quite well because just before Christmas, I got an email confirming that I was
to join 70,000 other volunteers on the Games Maker Team. So I made it to the last stage, all that was
left was the training, and the Olympic Games themselves :-). The only problem being that all the training
was due to be in London so I had to work out how to deal with that, without losing any more holiday days.
Thankfully, the LOCOG team were very helpful and accommodating where possible and I managed to get all my
training sessions scheduled in on weekends.</p>

<p>The first training session in February was a simple orientation session giving all Games Makers an idea
of what is involved in being a Games Maker, what was expected of everybody in terms of conduct etc, and
we were introduced to the uniforms. I have to admit, I was not really taken by the uniform at this point.</p>

<p>It was June before my training continued. First up was Uniform Distribution &amp; Accreditation Collection
(UDAC). The process was fairly simple. We were shepherded through a check in point, accreditations were
printed, shoes were tried on, uniforms were tried on and then we picked it all up. It was a remarkably
efficient process that seemed to take no time at all. Also quite unbelievably, whilst sat waiting for the
DLR at Canning Town station I was approached by a tall shifty looking character in a World Scout Moot -
Kenya 2010 t-shirt. Scouts! We seem to get everywhere. Turns out we were both heading to the same place,
and we were both good friends with the another dodgy character from Manchester, Troll. We got chatting and
soon zipped through uniform pickup.</p>

<p>In the last two training sessions, I got to learn about the role I had been assigned during the Games, and
the venue in which I would be doing it. More on that when I get there and find out for real :-).</p>

    <div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Blue Island Plane" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7377/12971188133_d0ee23134a_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7377/12971188133_d0ee23134a_q.jpg" alt="Blue Island Plane" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971188133/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The Jubilee weekend has brought us to Jersey to visit George’s
Auntie Liz (Rosie’s sister) &amp; Uncle Steve. We started the weekend on Friday evening with
George’s first flight which was a 19 seat ‘toy’ plane. I don’t think I’ve been so excited
about a flight since the first flight I remember going on myself too many years ago. It was
both exciting and scary at the same time because George’s reaction to this flight could affect
our future traveling quite considerably.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="George Goes Swimming" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7437/12971457924_cfe8316cf3_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7437/12971457924_cfe8316cf3_q.jpg" alt="George Goes Swimming" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971457924/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>Well, as usual, George missed the excitement through sleep! At this rate
people will start to think he does nothing but sleep! We arrived in Jersey on time after a
very uneventful flight (thankfully) and were taken swiftly out for dinner. At this point
George decided it was a good time to wake up and let the world know he existed, although not
for long, we still managed to have a good evening :-).</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="George Swimming!" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7365/12971017255_5655de0106_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7365/12971017255_5655de0106_q.jpg" alt="George Swimming!" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971017255/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>This morning Auntie Liz took us to the pool where she works so
that George could have his first proper swimming lesson. We stopped at the fish market on the
way to the pool to pick up food for our barbecue and, no surprise, George slept the whole time.
Liz arranged for us to have some time alone in the pool, which was absolutely brilliant. It was
great to have his first experience in a swimming pool in private. Rosie and I were fully
expecting him to scream on first dip, but quite to the contrary, he seemed very contented in
the water :-). Excellent!</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Liz &amp; George" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7447/12971147403_e127f6d832_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7447/12971147403_e127f6d832_q.jpg" alt="Liz &amp; George" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971147403/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>We swam him around the pool for almost half an hour before making the
difficult decision to fully submerge him. It was at this point that the fun stopped. George
screamed his head off as soon as he resurfaced, but we’re not too sure whether that was all
down to the submersion or the fact he was getting hungry from all the exercise.</p>

<p>Ever since we got home, George has been sleeping with short interludes for food. I think his
Auntie Liz has properly tired him out!</p>

    <div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="George &amp; I at the Bottom" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2891/12970759323_f5ed418109_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2891/12970759323_f5ed418109_q.jpg" alt="George &amp; I at the Bottom" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12970759323/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>Yesteday we decided it was about time George got to see a real
mountain so instead of taking the easy option and going up to Mynydd Maen, we went up to Storey
Arms with a view to taking a walk up to Pen-y-Fan. Obviously we were well aware of the potential
difficulties of taking a 7½ week old baby up a mountain, so we dragged along a good friend of
ours, Stewart Cunningham (<a href="http://diaryofascoutleader.blogspot.co.uk/" title="Diary of a Scout Leader">Diary of a Scout Leader</a>). We arrived at the Storey Arms car park at
about lunch time, I strapped George to my chest and off we went. It was a much cooler day than
it has been so thankfully we didn’t have to fight with the heat or the sun, just the walking :-).</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Family Photo on the Mountain" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7315/12971031044_650a2ec05b_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7315/12971031044_650a2ec05b_q.jpg" alt="Family Photo on the Mountain" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12971031044/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>About half way up the route to Corn Du we noticed that
the cloud level was starting to drop and it wasn’t looking too hopeful, but we soldiered on while
George slept happily in his sling with the proviso that if the weather started to turn we would
call it a day. It was a fairly slow walk, but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that
both Rosie and myself haven’t done a lot of proper walking recently, as well as Rosie having only
given birth to George 7½ weeks ago! The last hundred metres or so of climbing up Corn Du are quite
steep so things got a little more difficult, especially due to the fact George had decided it was
time to wake up. By the time we got to the top George was hungry, and the altitude was starting to
bother him so Rosie fed him at 873m above sea level just as the clouds fully closed in around us
making visibility severely limited.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="George &amp; I Half Way Up" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7310/12970618955_b201fc455e_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7310/12970618955_b201fc455e_q.jpg" alt="George &amp; I Half Way Up" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12970618955/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>By the time George was ready to go on, the weather had definitely
taken a turn for the worse so unfortunately we took the decision to turn back and skip Pen-y-Fan
for today. It was a bit disappointing having to turn around when we were so close, but on the other
hand we got to the top of Corn Du with a 7½ week old baby in March!!! :-) I think George had a good
day even if he was asleep for most of it.</p>

          <title>Our First Family Day Out</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="First Family Day Out-8599" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2940/13997229517_3707e206c7_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2940/13997229517_3707e206c7_q.jpg" alt="First Family Day Out-8599" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13997229517/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>Over the weekend we decided it was about time we
had our first family day out so, after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing about where to go, we
decided against the beach and headed up to the Forest of Dean to visit <a href="http://www.puzzlewood.net/" title="Puzzlewood">Puzzlewood</a>. The
place was described as a “Magical Day Out in the Forest of Dean”, but what grabbed us 
most about it was the belief that this part of the Forest of Dean was the inspiration for
the Forests of Middle Earth (the mythical land imagined by J. R. R. Tolkien in The Lord
of the Rings, for those Philistines who don’t know what/where Middle Earth is!).</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="First Family Day Out-8620" href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5477/13997197150_163470cceb_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5477/13997197150_163470cceb_q.jpg" alt="First Family Day Out-8620" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13997197150/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>On arrival, it didn’t look like much. The car park was a
field, there was a disused café on the way to the entrance and it seemed very quiet.
However, it really was amazing. Once we were inside the ticket office, we were greeted
with an array of cakes, chocolate, assorted souvenirs and some very welcoming staff. We
bought our tickets and got back out into the sunshine. On the path into the woods there
was a straw bale maze which was seriously cool, although George was rather nonplussed by
it.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="First Family Day Out-8641" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7387/13997196810_64e4a05984_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7387/13997196810_64e4a05984_q.jpg" alt="First Family Day Out-8641" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/13997196810/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The Puzzlewood itself was definitely a beautiful
place to visit. We entered the wood and it does immediately remind you (or at least it
reminded us) of some mythical forest from Middle Earth. Strange rock formations coated in
moss litter the entire area, there are barriers made out of the trees protecting visitors
from various sink holes and chasms all over the place. We slowly meandered our way around
Puzzlewood, taking in all the different sites, but George slept like a baby (obviously)
until we were about half way round. Was he thinking it was about time to have a look
himself? No. He wanted food, and he wanted it right now! It was nice an quiet where we were
so we sloped off down one of the many pathways and settled down on a bench for George to eat.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="First Family Day Out-8653" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2911/14183828254_fa62fbbcc9_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2911/14183828254_fa62fbbcc9_q.jpg" alt="First Family Day Out-8653" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/14183828254/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>For a change, George went straight back to sleep once he was
fed so Rosie and I carried on regardless and enjoyed the rest of our morning. Whilst having
lunch in the garden outside the new café we planned out the rest of our day. Next stop
Gloucester Cathedral, a filming location for some corridors in the Harry Potter films
including the one where the “The chamber of secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir
… beware” message was written on the wall.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="First Family Day Out-8686" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7411/14183825474_32098697a2_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7411/14183825474_32098697a2_q.jpg" alt="First Family Day Out-8686" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/14183825474/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>When we arrived we were greeted by an art exhibition
and a full concert rehearsal :-). It was brilliant. Whilst we wandered around the halls, we
got a preview of the concert due to be held on Saturday evening. It really gave the cathedral
a lively atmosphere. Typically, just as we were leaving, the choir and orchestra were coming
to a crescendo and George was sleeping happily in his pram. However, we needn’t have worried
as George was completely unphased by the whole thing and continued to enjoy his afternoon nap!</p>

<p>We finished up our first family day out with scones and cream at Gloucester Quays. It was a
great day out, but hopefully George will stay awake for more of the next one :-)</p>

          <title>Windows 8 Consumer Preview</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/reviews/windows-8-consumer-preview/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 18:47:07 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Richard Perry (richard@perrymail.me.uk)</author>
          <guid>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/reviews/windows-8-consumer-preview/</guid>
          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>At the end of last month Microsoft released their Consumer Preview for Windows 8 and, as 
usual, I couldn’t resist the temptation, so I promptly downloaded the ISO to have a
play :-). Now I think it’s about time I shared my experience with you.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>As you would expect with a new release of Windows, the installation process is once again 
very simple.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Insert the CD into the drive and boot the computer</li>
  <li>Select your language, time &amp; currency, and your keyboard layout	</li>
  <li>Click Install Now</li>
  <li>Enter your product code and agree to the Terms &amp; Conditions</li>
  <li>Select install type (Upgrade or Custom/Clean install)</li>
  <li>Choose where to install</li>
</ol>

<p>Once Windows has completed the installation steps, you are then guided through the initial 
Out of Box Experience (OOBE), otherwise known as the initial setup and personalisation of
the system. This is where you are first introduced to the new Metro UI. Each option screen
takes up the whole screen with no borders or menu bars etc. Finally, instead of asking you
to setup a user account on the computer, you are now presented with a screen asking you to
sign into you Microsoft account (previously known as a Windows Live ID). This isn’t
compulsory, there is an option to sign in without a Microsoft account at the bottom of the
screen.</p>

<p>That’s it. Now the computer loads up into the new operating system ready to go.</p>

<h3 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h3>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Start Screen" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7437/12970188325_9e8ce06a47_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7437/12970188325_9e8ce06a47_q.jpg" alt="Start Screen" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12970188325/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>Once Windows 8 is installed, you are presented with the brand
new Metro Start Button interface. This looks very much like the current Windows Phone
interface, but scrolls horizontally not vertically. This is the replacement for what we
currently know as the start button. This shows that Microsoft are now seriously looking at
the tablet market. The new interface is very much a new take on many of the popular tablet
interfaces currently on the market. I’m not too sure how successful this will be in a
desktop environment, but that is what I intend to find out, mainly due to me being devoid of
any form of tablet PC at my disposal.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Desktop" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7335/12970330183_93557476df_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7335/12970330183_93557476df_q.jpg" alt="Desktop" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12970330183/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The first thing that strikes you is that the
desktop is not loaded by default, although there is an item in the new Start Menu for the
desktop. The default view is the horizontal Start Menu. The ‘tiles’ are neatly arranged in
groups and you can move and resize these to suit yourself by simply right clicking the tile
you want to change and selecting the relevant option from the popup menu at the bottom of
the screen.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Start Button" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7329/12970602394_c5dd78117a_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7329/12970602394_c5dd78117a_q.jpg" alt="Start Button" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12970602394/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>To make the new UI function on a desktop, as well as a Tablet
PC, Windows 8 makes use of ‘Hot Corners’ for accessing the various menus normally accessed by
a swipe from the side. Holding the mouse into the lower left corner of the screen brings up
the new ‘Start Tip’ (what most people will think of as the new start button) so you can get
back to the Start Menu screen from within other applications, or from the desktop. The upper
left corner of the screen brings up the switcher showing the previous app in use, but moving
the mouse down along the side of the screen brings up other apps. Both right hand corners
bring out the new ‘Charms’ menu which gives you access to a number of system tools that are
accessible where ever you are in the new Windows 8 ecosystem. Most of these mouse over actions
are easy to used to and work very well, but I think I will prefer using WIN+TAB to get the
switcher up. That particular bit is a real pain to get right and it seems to disappear before
I get the chance to click what I want. I’m sure this is much easier with a tablet, and that
it is simply something I will need to get used to when I eventually upgrade properly.</p>

<p>In general I think Windows 8 is going to be another leap forward for Windows, and it all seems
very highly polished, but I’m not too sure how your average desktop/laptop user will fair with
it as it is clearly designed to be best used on a Tablet PC. I am going to keep using Windows
8 for a little while now to see how it fairs on a laptop, and maybe I’ll do another post about
how I fair with it in a few weeks.</p>

          <title>A New Addition</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>The day we have been waiting for for the last 9 months finally arrived on Monday 
night… the contractions began! After a few brief hours keeping the neighbours 
awake, we headed out to Nevill Hall Hospital for the start of a new life to begin. 
We were rushed through to the delivery suite and told that Rosie was already really 
far along so we needed to get the baby out asap. Some more screaming and heavy 
breathing ensued until, finally, at 13:47 the midwife announced… <strong>It’s a boy!</strong>
What an incredible feeling. It’s absolutely indescribable how utterly brilliant I 
felt getting that news. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m 100% positive I would have felt 
exactly the same had he been a girl instead, it was just amazing that this ever 
growing bump in Rosie’s belly was now an actual little person that I could hold in 
my arms!</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Me &amp; My Son" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2018/12969955615_8aa0b535f8_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2018/12969955615_8aa0b535f8_q.jpg" alt="Me &amp; My Son" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12969955615/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The midwife passed me my son whilst Rosie was sorted 
out and settled back into the bed. We looked at each other (well I looked and George 
angled his head in my general direction) and that was it, I was as happy as I have 
ever been. Once Rosie was ready I passed George over to her and could tell that all 
that pain and effort was evaporating from her memory as the result was wriggling 
gently in her arms.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Rosie &amp; George" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2516/12970096333_7feaf40eb0_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2516/12970096333_7feaf40eb0_q.jpg" alt="Rosie &amp; George" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12970096333/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>The rest of the afternoon was a bit of a 
blur, George was fed, Rosie had a bath, family was phoned and suddenly it was 17:00 
and we were being moved up to the ward. Rosie’s parents arrived just in time to come 
up with us to meet their new Grandson. The visiting hours in Nevill Hall are only 2 
hours, but in that time both sets of parents visited and Mark came bearing gifts. By 
19:00 Rosie was getting very tired so it was good that visiting hours were up. I was 
able to stay a little longer and spent most of the extra hour cuddling George.</p>

<p>I left just before I was kicked out with the promise that I would be back as early as 
the hospital would allow, in the morning, ready to take the two of them home.</p>

          <title>A New Start</title>
          <link>http://richard.perry-online.me.uk/general/a-new-start/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2011 18:00:16 +0000</pubDate>

          <description><![CDATA[
    <p>Today marks the end of a rather significant chapter in my life, and the start of a brand new one. 
Four weeks ago I handed my notice in at my current job having accepted a job working in the family 
business. I have worked with <a href="http://www.bam.co.uk" title="BAM Construction">BAM Construction</a> since the end of my second year at University. 
Over the last six and a half years, BAM have nurtured me and brought me from a bumbling University 
student to a calm and collected Chartered Quantity Surveyor. BAM have thrown me into various 
scenarios that have enabled me to grow and progress well in my time with them.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Bedminster Down School" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/12968074903_265639868d_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/12968074903_265639868d_q.jpg" alt="Bedminster Down School" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12968074903/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>In the early days, I worked on a site that was running 
very smoothly and had very few problems. This was a great introduction to the industry, and where 
I realised that I really knew squat about the job I was actually training for. The real world is 
very different to the world portrayed by University lecturers and so I began learning how to be a 
Trainee Quantity Surveyor from scratch, with very little help from my University background. Don’t 
get me wrong, the lessons learnt at University were invaluable, but didn’t seem to apply to the 
real world when I was starting out.</p>

<p>On completion of the school, I moved back to the head office for tendering. This was somewhere I 
had not been to since my interview so, to me, it was a big scary place. It turned out to be very 
different. The office atmosphere was a lot more subdued than the site atmosphere, but not at all 
scary. Everyone was friendly, and even the really senior staff would happily talk to you as an 
equal. It was at this point that I realised I had landed on my feet when BAM Construction offered 
me a job.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignleft"><span><a title="Bath Spa Bus Station" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7441/12968074783_179ef85225_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7441/12968074783_179ef85225_q.jpg" alt="Bath Spa Bus Station" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12968074783/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>After spending some time working on a hospital project 
in South Wales, I went to work on a new Bus Station in Bath. It was the first job I was going to 
work on from start to finish so I was looking forward to it. Having just moved back to South Wales, 
I was not looking forward to the commute. The job was an absolute nightmare commercially giving me 
endless experience with all sorts of different problems leading to me successfully completing my 
<abbr title="Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors">RICS</abbr> <abbr title="Assessment of Professional Competence">APC</abbr> and receiving my Chartership in 2009.</p>

<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Staple Hill front entrance - 4 days to handover" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7350/12968076123_1e40108b3c_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7350/12968076123_1e40108b3c_q.jpg" alt="Staple Hill front entrance - 4 days to handover" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12968076123/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<div class="flickr image alignright"><span><a title="Staple Hill rear terracing - 4 days to handover" href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7437/12968074373_f92fe4a108_b.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7437/12968074373_f92fe4a108_q.jpg" alt="Staple Hill rear terracing - 4 days to handover" /></a><a title="View on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richard-perry/12968074373/" class="flickrlink"> </a></span></div>
<p>I landed a 
job of my very own at the end of 2009. I was going to be the lead surveyor on Staple Hill Primary 
School in Bristol. At first I was a little nervous, maybe even scared, but then I became excited. 
This would be the first job where I would be able to prove myself. It was a great feeling, especially 
knowing that there would always be plenty of support available if I needed it. So I threw myself into 
it, joined the team and we delivered the project on time and under budget for the quality the client 
wanted. It was absolutely brilliant. The project team I was working with were always really friendly 
and dynamic, ready to deal with any issue that arose. We had a great relationship with the client and 
even a great relationship with the PQS so it seemed that, again, luck was on my side. The support of 
the team, and the relationship with the client has meant that we will walk away from the job in profit, 
which is brilliant in these markets.</p>

<p>So why then would I choose to leave such a brilliant job? Well, there aren’t very many reasons anyone 
would leave a job with BAM. I am going to work for a (relatively) small construction company in South 
Wales, run by my parents, and owned by my grandparents. The biggest benefit to this is that I will be 
closer to home when our little one arrives in February, and that is a huge plus point to me.</p>

<p>BAM have given me a brilliant start to my career and I’m especially grateful to them for all the support 
they have given me in my time with them. Now it is time for me to start the next chapter of my life with 
<a href="http://www.cpconstruction.co.uk" title="CP Construction">CP Construction</a>. I am looking forward to the new challenges presented by the completely different 
market I will be working in and hope to enjoy my new job as much as I enjoyed my last job.</p>
