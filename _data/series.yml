- name: "Mandarin Language Challenge"
  description: "Since early 2009 I have been learning Mandarin Chinese off and on. This may seem an odd
    language to choose so let me explain. In 2007 a good friend of ours told us about a Scouting trip he
    was organising to Russia, Mongolia & China (further details available
    [here](http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/trips/china-2009/). This seemed like a good idea at the time,
    and, to cut a long story short, Rosie & I decided to stay on in China for a further 5 weeks. The time
    we spent in China was absolutely amazing and I gained a real appreciation for the country, the culture
    and the language and I wanted to learn more.  I decided to learn the language to better understand the
    culture. Since then, it seems that my language learning has taken a bit of a back seat, with endless
    excuses rationalising why, so I have resolved to set up a language challenge to try to encourage me to
    get on with it!"

- name: "My Epic Quest"
  description: "I recently read an article on [Nerd Fitness](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/epic-quest/)
    where Steve Kamb had set out his goals for 'levelling up' his life. He used the metaphor of Role
    Playing Games to make the concept manageable and put together a list of challenges or quests that
    could be completed to advance from one level to the next. He then decided that each quest would be
    worth 20% experience towards the next level, there would also be Master Quests that equated to 100%
    experience, and this became his 'Epic Quest of Awesome'. I thought this was a pretty good idea, so
    using the same concept, I have come up with my own Epic Quest. It's no different to a bucket list
    that many people have, but it just sounds cooler :wink:"

- name: "Migrating to Jekyll"
  description: "At the back end of last year, I started migrating my various coding projects
    from [SVN](//subversion.apache.org/ 'Apache Subversion') repositories stored on 
    [Google Code](//code.google.com/ 'Google Code') to [Git](//git-scm.com/ 'Git') repositories.
    Through a little bit of research, I decided to use two different sites for different reasons,
    [GitHub](//github.com/ 'GitHub') for public repositories, and 
    [Bitbucket](//bitbucket.org/ 'Bitbucket - Free source code hosting for Git and Mercurial by Bitbucket')
    for backup and work (private) repositories. Finding GitHub also introduced me to something else
    that I found quite interesting, [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com/ 'GitHub Pages') is a hosting
    service provided by GitHub that allows you to publish websites from your repository. Not only
    that, but it works with something called
    [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/ 'Jekyll &bull; Simple, blog-aware, static sites'), a simple, blog-aware,
    static site generator. This intrigued me and so I looked into it and this series details my
    reasoning and process for Migrating from WordPress to Jekyll"

  description: "After sorting through some of our old photos, a lot of great memories were brought up
    from the various holidays/travels that Rosie & I have had since we met. This is a series of posts
    looking back on those holidays and travels. It doesn't include everything (for various reasons),
    but it does capture the memories from most of our holidays through the medium of imagery. Each post
    includes a gallery of some of the most memorable pictures from each holiday, along with a short
    write-up of the best bits. Hope you like it :smile:"

  description: "After being away from the blog for over 2 years, it is about time to explain what I've
    been up to and why I haven't been posting. This series is a catch up from my period of being absent
