So things kind of stalled on my Mandarin Language Challenge after I finished in 2012 (<small>actually, 
it stalled before the end, but that's another story :wink:</small>). Since then, I've dipped in and
out a bit here and there, but I haven't really done anything concrete, and I haven't kept it going
for any length of time. Now it is time to actually do something about it. Since the start of the
year I have been very busy with my [marathon training][1], but now I have a lot more time and I feel
it's time for another challenge to try to kickstart my learning again. 

This time, I am looking at a much more concrete end goal with some mini goals in between. I will be
keeping track of my progress and reporting back as regularly as I feel able. As additional motivation
for this challenge, I am going to be sitting either the HSK 3 or HSK 4 exam as close to the end of
September as I can. I will be looking at which level to go for towards the end of May once I have a
better idea of the level that I think I can actually achieve.

The HSK (or Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì/汉语水平考试) is China's only standardised test of Chinese Language
Proficiency for non-native speakers and as such, I think it is a good target. The following table
describes the current structure of the HSK system including the amount of vocabulary needed for each
level and a description of what each level represents. For more details, please visit the official
[Hanban website][2].

For the next week, I will be looking at getting my basic phrases and vocabulary back, doing some
pronunciation work and getting back into a routine with the learning materials I have. At the end of
the week, I will be publishing a video to show how things have gone. The idea will be to write a
very basic script in English, and try to translate it off the top of my head. Wish me luck :smile:.
