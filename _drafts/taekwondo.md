Earlier this year, George decided that he would like to do [Tae Kwon-do][1] because his friend was doing it. It turns out that she was part of a local club that has family classes, so we decided that George and I would have a go for a couple of weeks and see how it went.

It was nearly the end of June when we first turned up at Cwmbran Stadium to try [Tae Kwon-Do][1] with [Cwmbran & Pontypool Tae Kwon-Do Club][2]. George and I had no idea what to expect and we were both a little nervous. We were ushered into the hall to start the class and everyone was very welcoming. Although George clung to me during the warm up, he soon relaxed and started getting involved. After the warm up, there was some stretching, then we were partnered up with people of similar stature. This was when the fun really began! We started doing some simple kicks and punches with the pads, before moving into combinations. It was great fun, and George seemed to be enjoying himself.

After a couple of weeks, I asked George if he was enjoying it and he was, so we decided to join up properly. Unfortunately, by the time we got our act together, our teacher and his family had gone for an extended holiday and we couldn't get our Dobok's (uniform) or licences until their return. Nevermind!
