  Rack Raid is another brilliant local event that is put on by Fairwater
  Runners. It is an invitation only relay event for clubs in South Wales,
  starting at Grosmont Castle and finishing at the Castell-y-Bwch Pub. The route
  is approx. 100 miles split across 13 stages of varying length from 5-13 miles.
  Each stage starts and finishes at a castle/historic location and it is great
  fun. Every year I look forward to it, but this year I was quite concerened I
  would be letting the team down after being hit with ITB pain two weeks before
  the race (more on that in a future post).
