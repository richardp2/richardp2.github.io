Last weekend (_09/09/2017_) it was my birthday and George decided that he wanted to take me running for my birthday. I thought it was a really nice idea, but I wasn't sure he would get all the way around parkrun without getting bored. George, on the other hand, had other ideas. So Saturday morning, we all got up and headed to the [Riverfront parkrun][1] in Newport with the idea of running together. I think both Rose and I thought George would get bored and give up half way through so we tried bribery for encouragement :wink:. Whilst we got ourselves lined up at the start, we gave him a sweet to put in his pocket that he could eat at the halfway point.

After the briefing, the whistle went and we were off, running along the riverside. I set my watch up for a run walk strategy, 5 minutes running and 90 seconds walking, to try to make sure George didn't burn out too soon and give up. The first couple of sets we had to make sure he walked even though he wasn't keen on it, but as we were approaching the halfway point he wanted to walk before the 5 minutes were up. I'm not sure whether he actually needed to walk, but he definitely wanted to, so we tried to encourage him by telling him we were nearly at halfway and that seemed to work :grinning:.

As we rounded the last bend before the halfway point, George had a sudden burst of energy (_I think he just wanted his sweet!_) then got very shy when we got to the marshall so he wouldn't say hello. Instead, he started back whilst retrieving his sweet from his pocket.

<!--  George: Can we do parkrun?  -->
<!--  {:style="text-align: left"} -->
<!--  Me: Absolutely. It's on Sunday, but that doesn't matter does it?  -->
<!--  {:style="text-align: right"}  -->
<!--  George: No, can we do your parkrun on Saturday?  -->
<!--  {:style="text-align: left"} -->
<!--  Me: Well... yeah, I don't see why not.  -->
<!--  Do you think you can run the distance?  -->
<!--  {:style="text-align: right"}    -->
<!--  George: Of course I can!   -->
<!--  {:style="text-align: left"} -->
<!--  Me: No problem, we'll do that then :grinning:  -->
