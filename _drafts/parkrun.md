Last weekend (_09/09/2017_) it was my birthday and George decided that he wanted to take me running for my birthday. I thought it was a really nice idea, but I wasn't sure he would get all the way around parkrun without getting bored. George, on the other hand, had other ideas. So Saturday morning, we all got up and headed to the [Riverfront parkrun][1] in Newport with the idea of running together. I think both Rose and I thought George would get bored and give up half way through so we tried bribery for encouragement :wink:. At the start, we gave him a sweet to put in his pocket that he could eat at the halfway point. 

Here is how the conversation went:

> George: Can we do parkrun?  
> {:style="text-align: left"} 
> Me: Absolutely. It's on Sunday, but that doesn't matter does it?  
> {:style="text-align: right"}  
> George: No, can we do your parkrun on Saturday?  
> {:style="text-align: left"} 
> Me: Well... yeah, I don't see why not.  
> Do you think you can run the distance?  
> {:style="text-align: right"}    
> George: Of course I can!   
> {:style="text-align: left"} 
> Me: No problem, we'll do that then :grinning:  
> {:style="text-align: right"}
