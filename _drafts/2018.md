After a fairly poor end to 2017, 2018 has come as welcome change. As many 
already know, numerous problems over the last couple of years finally led to a
mass of redundancies, including both myself and Rosie, at the end of 2017. It
reallt wasn't a great way to end the year



Luckily for me, I had 
seen an advert for a small quantity surveying consultancy looking to grow a few 
months earlier and they were still looking. I was admitted as a new partner for 
the firm ([VOLOCO LLP][1]) on 1st January 2018 and so the year began with a 
bang.



### New Job

I officially finished working for [CP Construction][2] on 2nd February, although
my first day with [VOLOCO][1] was 23rd January.


### Education

Towards the end of 2017, given I was going to be made redundant, I decided to
sign up for a course that I had been looking at for a while, the [RICS Diploma
in Arbitration][3]
