This Easter we decided it was finally time to visit Paris. I've been promising to take Rosie there
for almost as long as we've known each other and I thought it was about time. Also when we left
Disney in Hong Kong after my 25th birthday, we decided to do another one for Rosie's 25th. We may be
2 years late, but we have finally made it. Not only did we decide to visit Disney in Paris, but we
chose to stay at Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch :smiley:.

To try to make the most of our first day in France, we decided to set off on Easter Monday and stay
over in Folkestone. Early Tuesday morning, we met up with Mark & Carolyn and jumped on the Shuttle,
arriving at the Davy Crockett Ranch by 1pm. We picked up our park tickets and headed straight over
to Disney :smiley:.

After picking up a wheelchair and disabled pass for Mark, we were all pretty hungry so we grabbed a
bite to eat in one of the cafés on Main Street. This was how we discovered just how expensive food
was. It cost us approximately €25 per person for a hot dog, chips and a drink. Ah well! Finally we
felt ready to take on the park.

The park was about 10 minutes drive (1 exit on the motorway) from the Ranch,but there were no
shuttle buses provided so we had to drive ourselves there and back each day, not really an issue,
but it is the only Disney hotel that does not have access provided. This was then followed by a 10
minute walk from the car park to the main entrance to the two Disney Parks.
