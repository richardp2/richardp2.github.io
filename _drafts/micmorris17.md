  The Mic Morris Torfaen 10k is a fast, downhill 10k road race that starts in Blaenavon and finishes in Pontypool Park. The plan this year was to run the race with Rosie to try to help her get a new PB, and maybe even break the 1 hour mark for the 10k. Unfortunately, the world conspired against us and Rose had to pull out of the race 10 days before. We were both a little disappointed but, looking on the postive side, it gave me the opportunity to see how I would do on a fast, downhill 10k race

> Mic Morris was a police officer and brilliant British international middle distance runner from Pontypool who died aged just 24 years during a training run in 1983.  The trust fund was set up between Gwent Police and Torfaen Council to raise money for Torfaenâ€™s elite young sports people, specifically for young people aged 11 to 21 who live in Torfaen.
