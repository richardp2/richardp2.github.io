As many of you know, I'm currently training for the [Gloucester City Marathon][gcm]
on 06 August. The training had been going well, until I made a bit of a stupid
mistake with it. As any runner knows, it's important to increase your mileage
gradually to help prevent injury. Also, in the past, I have tried to keep a good
routine of injury prevention based strength work going alongside my main
training. I have always stuck to this and, for that reason, I've been injury
free for about 3 years. Until now of course!

I've been adding extra miles to my runs, doing extra runs etc and skipping
strength workouts to the point where I broke myself :disappointed:.
