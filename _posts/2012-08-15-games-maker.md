Over the last two weeks or so, you may have been aware of a small sporting event taking place mainly
in London known as the Olympic Games. Well I volunteered to work at the Games and was fortunate enough
to be accepted as one of the 70,000 Games Makers who would be a huge part of making the Games happen.

{% flickr_image 12971260605 alignright %}My Games began on Monday 30 July so I was able to watch the 
opening ceremony from the comfort of my own sofa  :-). I left for London on the afternoon of 29 July
to make my new home at [Blackheath Rugby Club][brc] courtesy of [Camping Ninja][cn]. Check In was
relatively simple so once my tent was up I was able to get an early night ready for my first day at
the [ExCeL Centre][ec].

{% flickr_image 12971211095 %}My first three days were morning shifts starting at the area known as
the Hub (i.e. the main hive of activity between Custom House DLR Station and the main entrance to
the ExCeL Centre). After meeting up with a number of other new Games Makers and being issued our pink
hi-vis vests, we were ready to start. My role basically involved smiling a lot, assist the signage in
directing spectators to the main entrance and answering any and all questions asked to the best of my
ability. Now I'm not really too familiar with the Docklands area of London, but after endless
questions along the lines of:
	
  * Where do I find ...;
  * How do I get to ...;
  * Is there a ... near here etc.

{% flickr_image 12971279915 alignright %}I began to get acquainted with the area fairly quickly. As much
as it seems this would be a very boring experience, it was far from it. In the first three days, I met
people from all over the world who were extremely excited and enthusiastic about the Olympic Games.
Working among that level of excitement and enthusiasm makes it very difficult for anyone to be bored, we
even got the opportunity to 'borrow' some empty seats in the fencing arena after shift one day ;-). At
the end of my first three days, I was quite tired but I did have an amazing time :-).

My first day off brought me back to Wales to visit Rosie & George and to chill out a bit. It was great
to see them both again, but I was soon on my way back to London for my next three days. This time I was
on afternoon shifts so I decided to make the most of the extra time I had by visiting the ExCeL centre
to watch more of the events taking place there (and maybe get a sneaky extra meal voucher for lunch to
save some cash ;-))

{% flickr_image 12971689204 %}I spent my next day off in London on my own, so, bearing in mind I  had
no chance of getting into the Olympic Park, I decided to go hunting Harry Potter filming locations in
central London (it also meant I got to make full use of my Games Maker Oyster Card :-P). I also tried
to get into Hyde Park to watch some of the Games on the big screen, but the rain put me off a bit.

The second week continued in much the same vein as the last, standing on various street corners directing,
chatting and laughing with people from all over the world... so it was obviously brilliant! I managed to
confuse some Mongolians by greeting them in Mongolian, followed by telling the story of our
[wild adventures][adv] in Mongolia. The best thing about being able to greet people in their own language 
had to be the looks on their faces when they realise what you have said. It's certainly a good conversation 
starter ;-) (even if that conversation does take place in English).

{% flickr_image 12971669154 alignright %}Rosie and George joined me in London for my last three days meaning
I got to move out of the tent and into a hotel :-). We visited Kew Gardens on my day off, but it wasn't as
relaxing as I'd hoped. Unfortunately all this standing around for hours and hours every day was starting to
take a toll on the soles of my feet so I was starting to suffer a bit by the end of the day.

{% flickr_image 12971655604 %}The whole experience was absolutely magical and from the moment I started,
right to the end, I was having a good time (yes, even the slow times at the boring locations) and I am
immensely proud to have been involved! It was a fantastic experience and I am very glad I was a part of
the London 2012 Olympic Games, although I now wish I could help out at the Paralympic Games as well. It
certainly helps that I was able to see a fair bit of sport from some tidy 'borrowed' seats in the ExCeL
Centre itself :-).

So who's up for Rio 2016? Only kidding (I think)
