I was recently listening to a [Radio 4 Podcast][r4] entitled ["The Rise of the
Robots"][ror] that got me thinking. It was a three part series that looked at
the past, present and future of robots and how they have developed in our
society both culturally and technologically. The first episode was concerned
with where the idea of the robot originated and looked at robots/automata of
the past. I was very surprised to discover the first recorded concept of a robot
was in Ancient Greece (_although I suppose I shouldn't really be surprised by
that given what the Ancient Greeks actually achieved in their time_). It was
very interesting, but what really got me thinking was episode 2.

  you're interested in that, then read on :wink:_

The second episode concerned robots in present society and how their current
reality has been influenced by science fiction of the last century. Every since
the first robot was introduced to the production line in 1959[^1], "experts"
have been predicting that robots would be replacing us at work and we would be
left jobless. To a certain extent, that is true. A large proportion of
mechanistic tasks in factories are now carried out by robots, but as a society
in general, we are working more. In 1959 the world population was a shade under
3 billion and we are now at around 7&frac12; billion people[^2]. In theory,
based on the proliferation of robots in industry and the massive population
growth, you would expect unemployment to be through the roof but instead UK
unemployment has gone from 2.3%[^3] to 4.7%[^4] approximately. Don't get me
wrong, that is a huge increase, especially when you consider the number of
people but it doesn't exactly show that the 'robots' are taking our jobs. I
realise that using UK unemployment rates as the basis for my argument is a
little ridiculous, but these are merely my personal musing so I don't really
care. 

However, I do think that the day will come when 'robots' are carrying out a lot
more everyday tasks. In the construction industry, which is traditionally very
labour intensive, and often seen as been a little behind the times, there are
already significant moves towards off-site manufacturing, modular construction
etc. These techniques off load a certain amount of the labour intensive works to
a factory that, although manned, will have a large number of robots/machines
carrying out the more mechanistic, repetitive tasks, thereby reducing the number
of jobs available for the workforce of the future. Although, I'm not entirely
sure this is a bad thing given the struggles we are currently having in the
construction industry with recruitment and training. According to the recent
[Construction Leadership Council][clc] report [Modernise or Die][mod][^5]
entrants to the construction industry are significantly lower than leavers year
on year, and woefully inadequate to cover the labour requirements moving forward
if the industry doesn't change. If robots took over the vast majority of the
work through off site manufacture (_and clients actually chose modern methods of
construction over traditional_) then the impact of people not wanting to work in
the industry would be hugely reduced.

Taking this a step further, and more towards science fiction, I can see a
potential future where our economy more closely matches that depicted in 
programmes like Star Trek[^6].



If you have any interest in robots/robotics, then I would highly recommend
checking out the [series at Radio 4][ror]. The episodes are only a &frac12;hour
each.
