I was recently listening to a [Radio 4 Podcast][r4] entitled ["The Rise of the Robots"][ror]
that got me thinking. The podcast was obviously looking at robots in our society, but what
was interesting was how it was presented. It was a three part series that looked at the
past, present and future of robots and their how they have developed in our society both
culturally and technologically. The first episode was concerned with where the idea of the
robot originated and looks at robots/automata of the past. I was very surprised to
discover the first recorded concept of a robot was in Ancient Greece (_although I suppose
shouldn't really be surprised by that given what the Ancient Greeks actually achieved in
their time_). It was very interesting, but what really got me thinking was episode 2.

The second episode concerned robots in present society and how their current reality has
been influenced by science fiction of the last century. Every since the first robot was
introduced to the production line in 1959[^1], "experts" have been
predicting that robots would be replacing us at work and we would be left jobless. To a 
certain extent, that is true. A large proportion of mechanistic tasks in factories are now
carried out by robots, but as a society in general, we are working more. In 1959 the world
population was a shade under 3 billion and we are now at around 7&frac12; billion people.
In theory, based on the proliferation of robots in industry and the massive population
growth, you would expect unemployment to be through the roof but instead it has gone from
2.3% to 5.2% approximately[^3]. Don't get me wrong, that is a massive increase, especially
when you consider the vast increase in the number of people 



If you have any interest in robots/robotics, then I would highly recommend
checking out the [series at Radio 4][ror]. The episodes are only a &frac12;hour each.
