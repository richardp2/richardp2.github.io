This is my favourite photo from our week in Scotland with
[FreeSpirit ESU](http://freespiritesu.org.uk/campdiaries/lochgoilhead2012/).
Three of the leaders (& George) decided to take a trip over to Inverary, mainly
to visit [Loch Fyne Whiskies](http://www.lfw.co.uk/) (supposedly the "finest
whiskey retailer in the world"), but also to see the area. As we stood looking
out over the harbour, this was the view. It was absolutely stunning and I really
think this photo has captured the scene so it's one I'm really proud of :-) !!
