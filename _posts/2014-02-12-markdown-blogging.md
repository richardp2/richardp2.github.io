I have decided to give Jekyll a go via GitHub Pages, and as part of this I thought I should try using markdown only. 

This is my first proper post using it, so let's see how it looks. 

My aims are as follows:
 * Put together a responsive html5 template for the testing site; 
 * write some development based blog posts; 
 * test if Jekyll is a viable alternative to WordPress for my personal blog. 

So let's get started :-)
