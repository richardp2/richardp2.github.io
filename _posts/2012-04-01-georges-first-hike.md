{% flickr_image 12970759323 %}Yesteday we decided it was about time George got to see a real
mountain so instead of taking the easy option and going up to Mynydd Maen, we went up to Storey
Arms with a view to taking a walk up to Pen-y-Fan. Obviously we were well aware of the potential
difficulties of taking a 7½ week old baby up a mountain, so we dragged along a good friend of
ours, Stewart Cunningham ([Diary of a Scout Leader]). We arrived at the Storey Arms car park at
about lunch time, I strapped George to my chest and off we went. It was a much cooler day than
it has been so thankfully we didn't have to fight with the heat or the sun, just the walking :-).

{% flickr_image 12971031044 alignright %}About half way up the route to Corn Du we noticed that
the cloud level was starting to drop and it wasn't looking too hopeful, but we soldiered on while
George slept happily in his sling with the proviso that if the weather started to turn we would
call it a day. It was a fairly slow walk, but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that
both Rosie and myself haven't done a lot of proper walking recently, as well as Rosie having only
given birth to George 7½ weeks ago! The last hundred metres or so of climbing up Corn Du are quite
steep so things got a little more difficult, especially due to the fact George had decided it was
time to wake up. By the time we got to the top George was hungry, and the altitude was starting to
bother him so Rosie fed him at 873m above sea level just as the clouds fully closed in around us
making visibility severely limited.

{% flickr_image 12970618955 %}By the time George was ready to go on, the weather had definitely
taken a turn for the worse so unfortunately we took the decision to turn back and skip Pen-y-Fan
for today. It was a bit disappointing having to turn around when we were so close, but on the other
hand we got to the top of Corn Du with a 7½ week old baby in March!!! :-) I think George had a good
day even if he was asleep for most of it.
