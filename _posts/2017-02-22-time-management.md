I recently read an [article][tm] on the Guardian website (_thanks Graham :smile:_) about
[time management][tm] that really got me thinking. In a nutshell, I feel that the [Guardian article][tm]
has got the right idea, time management, at least the way it is pushed today, is flawed and not
actually helpful to anyone. If you want to know more, then read on :wink:.

Over the years, I've been on a number of different management courses, including specific time
management courses, through work. After each course, I diligently try to implement the practices and
ideas given and within a couple of weeks, I'm more stressed than I was before! I always put this
down to the fact that my workload had increased and I was just getting overwhelmed.

> Most of us have experienced this creeping sense of being overwhelmed: the feeling not merely that
> our lives are full of activity – that can be exhilarating – but that time is slipping out of our
> control. 

Now I can see it from a different perspective. We are always beig told that we need to work faster,
more efficiently and get more done, but by trying to do this we are setting ourselves up for
failure.
