Since mid March, I have been going to Torfaen Freerunning Academy at the Torfaen Academy of Gymnastics in New Inn. I've
been quite interested in the concept of Parkour/Freerunning for a while so I thought it would be fun. Although I am quite
a bit older than the vast majority of the people there, I have been welcomed and supported brilliantly since I joined. I
have been working on vaults and flips from the start and on 26 April, I completed my first unsupported backflip :smiley:.
So here's the video (granted this was taken the following week when I had cleaned it up a bit).
