It has now been a month since I started my Mandarin Chinese language challenge, so I think it's time
for an update on how I'm doing. To be honest, it's not being going all that well. The first week
went quite well, I was generally following my study plan (except for some evening sessions), but
then it became unworkable. I guess I didn't really plan it well enough, so I have amended the plan
in an attempt to make it easier to follow without reducing the commitment needed. Well, it still
isn't really working. Here is a summary of the key points from this month.

### The Good
	
  * I do listen to Mandarin radio most of the day in work;
  * I have kept up with my vocabulary on [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com) (up to over 400 words now, although I did start that earlier this year).

###  The Bad

  * I haven't been working on my Mandarin every day;
  * I still haven't spoken to anyone yet (other than George & myself);
  * I haven't put much on my new Mandarin [Twitter](http://twitter.com/richard_p2_ZH) account yet.

Generally my commitment over the last month has been fairly poor for various reasons, but mainly
because I am enjoying spending time with my son when I get home and by the time he goes to bed and
we've eaten, I don't feel like doing anything else. This is definitely not the right attitude if I
want to improve so I am going to try to do better this month.

I will upload a video or audio clip of me speaking Mandarin in the next couple of days to show the
progress I have/haven't made.

### Plans for October
	
  * Practice more than twice a week;
  * Publish at least one journal entry to [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com) per week;
  * Publish at least two audio clips to [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/);
  * Learn at least 200 new characters using [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com).
