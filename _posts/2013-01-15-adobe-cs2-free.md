[![Adobe CS2][cs2]][img]Earlier this month, Adobe published a [list][adobe] of download links and 
serial numbers for their Creative Suite 2 software including Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat & others.
Suddenly the internet was awash with speculations that Adobe had in fact released Adobe CS2 for free.
This is not quite how it was meant to happen though. What actually happened is this:

In December 2012, Adobe turned off their activation servers for CS2 because the software has been
around since 2005 and doesn't play nicely with the latest versions of Windows and Mac OS X. A number
of CS2 users then encountered problems when reinstalling the software for whatever reason and so
there were complaints made to Adobe. In response to this, they published a list of serial numbers and
links to download the software that did not require activation. This was originally only available
with an Adobe account.

When people started advertising the 'free' software, Adobe piped up and stated that the software was
only for people that have previously bought CS2 and were having problems with activation. However,
this was not published on the [download page][adobe] and worse still, they have now taken off the
requirement to log into their site to download the software. So, for all intents and purposes, Adobe
CS2 is now available free of charge.

A number of people across the internet have now read through the EULA included with the downloaded
software and found that as long as you download the software from their webpage and use the license
keys supplied it is completely legal to install and use CS2 free of charge. Please note, however,
that Adobe don't 'officially' agree with this.
