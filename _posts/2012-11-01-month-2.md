We are now into the third month of my Mandarin Chinese language challenge, so here is an update to
how month 2 has gone. Lets start by updating you on my targets from last month.

### 1. Practice more than twice a week

This time I think I just about managed to practice more than twice a week, although still not as
much as I would have liked.

### 2. Publish at least one journal entry to [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/) per week

The Lang-8 community are very helpful and I have been inundated with corrections when I have
actually submitted an entry, but I did not manage to achieve the requisite on entry per week this
month, maybe I will manage it next month. These are my entries for October for anyone that is
interested.

#### [Week 1 - 关于我 / About Me](http://lang-8.com/280403/journals/1710811/%25E5%2585%25B3%25E4%25BA%258E%25E6%2588%2591)

我住在一个小城镇叫Pontypool。它是在威尔士南部。
我住跟我的太太和儿子一起。我的儿子是八个月大。
我是一个童军领袖。 我享受攀岩，皮划艇和步行。

I live in a small town called Pontypool. It is in South Wales.
I live with my wife and son. My son is eight months old.
I am a Scout Leader. I enjoy climbing, kayaking and walking.

#### [Week 3 - 家庭的一天 / Family Day Out](http://lang-8.com/280403/journals/1740662/%25E5%25AE%25B6%25E5%25BA%25AD%25E7%259A%2584%25E4%25B8%2580%25E5%25A4%25A9)

昨天我的太太，我的儿子和我去看看在 Bristol 动物园的 恐龙。我们也看看企鹅，灰沼狸和猴。我们有一个非常愉快的一天，
George 也有乐趣。我们吃晚饭在McDonald's。

Yesterday my wife, my son and I went to Bristol Zoo to see the dinosaurs. We also saw the penguins,
meerkats & monkeys. We had a very nice day and George had fun too. We had dinner at McDonald's.

And I'm afraid that's it for this month!

### 3. Publish at least two audio clips to [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/)

So I planned to record at least two audio clips to put up on Soundcloud during October, and it was
very touch and go, but I just about managed it. The first clip was a basic introduction/about me
discussion that was scripted (and corrected via [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/)), although I didn't
practice it so it was quite disjointed. Hopefully it wasn't too bad in terms of the Mandarin usage,
but I haven't had any comments so maybe this platform isn't going to be the best way forward. I'll
give it a bit more time before making that decision though.

#### 关于我 About Me

My second clip was a recitation of a lullaby sung by Jackie Chan in the Spy Next Door (quite a funny
film as it happens). I thought it sounded very gentle so I am now learning it to sing to George.
This is the level I am at with it at the moment (this was read from a script as I can't remember
the words just yet :-)).

#### Ba Ma De Hua

So both clips this month are a little disjointed, slow and hard to listen to, but it's a start. I am
aiming to do a lot more of this in future to improve the flow of my speaking. All in all I'm quite
pleased so far.

### 4. Learn at least 200 new characters using [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/)

I tried really hard with this this month, but I missed a few days in the middle and have been trying
to catch up every since. Still, I managed to get through nearly 150 new characters so I'm more than
happy with that.

### Conclusion

As I suspected, it still wasn't a brilliant month for progress, but I think I'm definitely getting
better so I am much happier than I was at the end of September. Instead of looking back at how I did
this month, I am going to look forward to what I aim to do next month :-).

#### Plans for November

  * Learn another 150 characters using [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/);
  * Publish at least three audio clips to [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/);
  * At least learn the words to [Ba Ma De Hua](http://soundcloud.com/richardpperry/ba-ma-de-hua) by heart;
  * Complete the remaining lessons of [Pimsleurs](http://www.pimsleur.com/Learn-Mandarin-Chinese) Mandarin 1.
