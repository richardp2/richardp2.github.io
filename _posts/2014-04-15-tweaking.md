This is going to be my last post on my Migration from [WordPress][wp] to [Jekyll][jk] 
(_I promise :blush:_). This week I am going to share with you some of the changes I've made, and
plugins I've adapted to get everything running the way it was (<small>ish</small>) in WordPress.
I've had to make a few changes to the site to suit the new system as well, but nothing major.

### Tags

You may have noticed (<small>but probably not really, that's kind of the point</small>) that there
are no longer any tags listed at the bottom of each post. Tags are a standard part of WordPress that
I embraced for no other reason than 'they were there'. Their purpose was to allow navigation between
posts of similar topics that were not necessarily in the same category. To be honest, I don't write
all that many posts, and I don't have thousands of people rading my blog so I decided they were
completely unnecessary and ditched them in the migration.

### Categories

I have also made a few changes to the categories. This is partially due to the way Jekyll handles
categories, and partially due to me wanting to rationlise it a bit. In Jekyll, posts cannot be linked
to multiple categories in the same way as WordPress. If there are multiple categories listed, they
become subcategories of each other. For this reason, I had to adjust some of them so that they
worked properly. For example, if an Instagram picture post included George, I filed it in both the
Photography category and the George category. In Jekyll, this results in the post being included in
the Photography/George (<small>or George/Photography depending on the order</small>) category, not
two separate ones.

Jekyll does not generate category pages for you, so I looked at a few options for achieving this.
Firstly, I made use of a standard plugin for generating the pages. I then made a few modifications
to the plugin to get a result I preferred, and finally I adopted part of the plugin for generating
the category list displayed at the top of each post and ditched the rest in favour of coding my own
category pages. The plugin I am now using looks a little bit like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Category Links Filter
#
# The original plugin was created by Dave Perrett and is available here:
# http://recursive-design.com/projects/jekyll-plugins/
#
# The modifications include:
#   - Removing category page generation classes completely
#   - Modified the category_dir function to only use the first word in
#     multiword categories and to link them together to create the path
#   - Modified the category_links function to use titlecase for the 
#     displayed category names

module Jekyll
  module Filters

    def category_dir(base_dir, category)
      base_dir = base_dir.gsub(/^\/*(.*)\/*$/, '\1')
      category = category.split
      category = category[0].gsub(/_|\P{Word}/, '-').gsub(/-{2,}/, '-').downcase
      File.join(base_dir, category)
    end 

    def category_links(categories)
      base_dir = @context.registers[:site].config['category_dir']
      @categorydir = ''
      categories = categories.map do |category|
        base_dir = File.join(base_dir, @categorydir) unless @categorydir == ''
        @categorydir = self.category_dir(base_dir, category)
        # Make sure the category directory begins with a slash.
        @categorydir = "/#{@categorydir}" unless @categorydir =~ /^\//
          "<a class='category' href='#{@categorydir}/'>#{category.titlecase}</a>"
      end

      @categorydir = ''

      case categories.length
        when 0
          ""
        when 1
          categories[0].to_s
        else
          categories.join(', ')
      end
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Pages

The way pages are organised in Jekyll is a little too messy for my liking so I have adopted a simple
plugin that will keep pages organised in the same way as posts. They sit in a folder called '_pages'
rather than in the root of the repository. This keeps the root folder tidier :smile:. The plugin was
written by Ben Baker-Smith and is available from [here][ppl]

### Draft Post Publishing

Also in Jekyll, drafts are kept separate in a '_drafts' folder, but there is no real way to handle 
them when they are ready to publish other than to move the file to the '_posts' folder and rename it
prior to deploying the update. This is not a difficult task, but they is a better way. [Rake][rk] 
is a build program that is used by a lot of web programmers to automate simple, but time consuming
tasks. This seemed to me to be the perfect solution, but my distinct lack of skills in [Ruby][rb] 
meant I had to start with [Google][gg]. This led me to a script by [Shane Burkhart][sb] that was
almost exactly what I wanted. With a few minor tweaks I ended up with this:

{% highlight ruby %}
# The following task was adapted from one written by Shane Burkhart  
# Source: http://www.shaneburkhart.me/2013/12/07/rake-task-to-publish-drafts-in-jekyll.html  

desc "Publish draft posts and update the date field"  
task :publish, [:file] do |t, args|
  require "time"

  if args[:file]
    file = "_drafts/#{args[:file]}"
    text = File.read(file)
    time = Time.now.iso8601.gsub!('T', ' ')
    text.gsub!(/^date.*$/, "date: #{time}")
    today = Time.now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    post_name = file.split("/").last
    dest = "_posts/#{today}-#{post_name}"
    File.open(dest, 'w') {|f| f.write(text) }
    puts "Published file #{post_name}"
    File.delete(file)
    puts "Deleted draft file #{post_name}"
  else
    puts "Incorrect usage of the :publish task"
    puts "\n\tUsage:"
    puts "\trake publish[draft-post.md]"
    puts "\nPlease try again"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

This also led me to automating a load of different tasks to generally make my life easier. If you're
interested, you can view my full 'Rakefile' [here][myrk]
.

### Series

My final tweak for the site was to reintroduce Post Series like I had on WordPress. The idea of a
series is that posts about the same topic (like this one) include a list of all the related posts at
the beginning of the post so that anyone reading it can refer back if they are interested. This is
again not a standard function of Jekyll, but with a bit of research I found a great plugin written
by [R.J. Lorimer][rjl] that was just what I needed. (As usual) I made a few modifications and this
is the result:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Series List Tag
#
# The original plugin was created by R.J. Lorimer and is available here:
# https://github.com/realjenius/site-samples/blob/master/2012-11-04-jekyll-series-list-2/series_tag.rb
#
# The modifications include:
#   - Using a data file (series.yml) to add more detail to the series
#   - Modified the output of the tag to look the way I wanted it to

module Jekyll
  
  class SeriesTag < Liquid::Tag
    def initialize(tag_name, params, tokens)
      super
    end

    def render(context)
      site = context.registers[:site]
      page_data = context.environments.first["page"]
      series = site.data['series']
      series_name = page_data['series']
      series_image = ""
            
      if !series_name
        puts "Unable to find series name for page: #{page.title}"
        return "<!-- Error with series tag -->"
      end
      
      series.each do |s|
        if s['name'] == series_name[0]
          series_image = "<img src='#{s['image']}' title='#{series_name[0]}' alt='#{series_name[0]}'>\n" if s['image']
          if s['copyright']
            series_image = "<figure>\n#{series_image}\n<figcaption>#{s['copyright']}</figcaption>\n</figure>"
          end
        end
      end

      all_entries = []
      site.posts.each do |p|
        if p.data['series'] == series_name
          all_entries << p
        end
      end

      all_entries.sort_by { |p| p.date.to_f }

      text = "<div class='series_list'>\n"
      text += "#{series_image}"
      list = "<ol>\n"
      all_entries.each_with_index do |post, idx|
        list += "<li>"
        if post.data['title'] == page_data['title']
          list += "#{post.data['title']}"
        text += "<h4>#{post.data['series'][0]}</h4>"
        else
          list += "<a href='#{post.url}'>#{post.data['title']}</a>"
        end
        list += "</li>\n"
      end
      text += list += "</ol>\n</div>\n"
      
    end
  end
end

Liquid::Template.register_tag('series_list', Jekyll::SeriesTag)
{% endhighlight %}

I combined this with a custom template for the series pages and now article series work better than
they did before :smile:. 

### Conclusion

Over the last couple of weeks, and previously the last couple of months, I've documented the process
I've gone through to migrate my blog from WordPress to Jekyll. Hopefully some of it has been
interesting to some people, but really I've written it as a reference for myself. 

I have very much enjoyed learning about Jekyll and how it works, as well as bits of a new
programming language, but mostly I've enjoyed tinkering with something that already works fine. I
feel that I am definitely a bit of a tinkerer, but there's no harm in it really, is there? :wink:
