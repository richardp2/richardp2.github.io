excerpt: 'I am planning to run my first marathon (Greater Manchester Marathon) this
  year on 19 April. I have been training hard to make sure I can actually cover the
  distance, but until I managed to complete my longest training run I was not convinced
  it would be possible. However, now I actually believe I can do it :-).

As mentioned [previously][2], I am planning to run my first marathon this year. I will be running 
the [Greater Manchester Marathon][1] on 19 April (all being well) and as such I have been [training][3]
hard to make sure I can actually cover the distance. Since the last week in December I have:

* run a total of 394.2 miles as part of my training (_<small>Last year it took me almost 10 months
  to cover that distance!</small>_);
* taken 40 seconds of my [parkrun][4] PB;
* taken 9 minutes 25 seconds off my half marathon PB;
* and really enjoyed the volume of running :smile:.

Despite all of this, I was still a little apprehensive about actually running 26.2 miles in one go.
That is until yesterday when I completed the longest run of my [training plan][3]. I ran a total of
22.28 miles and realised that all the training really is paying off. I was definitely tired and
aching at the end of it, but I really feel that now I am actually ready to face this challenge head
on. 

**Just over 33 days to go and now I'm really excited!!! :grinning:**
