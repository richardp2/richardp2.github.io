Happy New Year all! I really cannot be bothered with the whole year in review thing that I did last
year, so instead I'm going to write about my new challenges for the year. If you're not interested,
please feel free to leave this site now, I won't get upset :wink:.

### Running

![ASICS Greater Manchester Marathon][thm1]{: .alignright }
My first challenge for this came about almost by accident. At the end of the summer last year, my
[Running Club][1] started the ballot for who would get the 2 [London Marathon][2] places that the
club were entitled to. I figured there was no harm putting my name into the ballot as I probably
wouldn't get it anyway. As it happens I was right, but my brain seemed to think that this marathon
thing was a good idea (possibly because it'll tick off another item on my [Epic Quest][5]) and
finally, over the Christmas period I cracked and signed up for the 
[ASICS Greater Manchester Marathon][3] the weekend before the London Marathon in April. So my first
challenge for the year is to train for and complete my first marathon :fearful:.

I'm not sure if this is the best idea I have ever had, but I am looking forward to the challenge. My
first weeks training didn't quite go to plan due to being on holiday, having a poorly toddler one
day and being ill myself for the whole of the first weekend, but the second week was spot on and I
will try harder going forward :wink:.

### Languages

I will continue working on my [Mandarin][4] during my Marathon training, but once the marathon is
done, I will look at where I am and where I'm going more closely with the aim of setting a new
Mandarin Challenge in April/May that will run for 3 months, probably with the aim of having a 15
minute conversation with a native speaker, but we'll have to see.

After that, I have been thinking that it's about time I started looking into Welsh. George is going 
to have to learn Welsh at school, and I think it would be a good idea for me to have a good
grounding in it before then so that I can help him with his homework. Again, I will flesh out the
actual challenge element closer to the time but I'll be aiming to get a good handle on the basics
for the first couple of years of George's education :smiley:.

### Other

Although I think that is more than enough to keep me busy for the rest of the year, I still have my
[Epic Quest][5] so I may look at that to see if there is anything I could sensibly achieve this year
on top of everything else, but with my life currently revolving around marathon training, this will
have to be looked at later :wink:.
