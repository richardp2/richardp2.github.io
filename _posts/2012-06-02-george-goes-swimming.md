The Jubilee weekend has brought us to Jersey to visit George’s
Auntie Liz (Rosie’s sister) & Uncle Steve. We started the weekend on Friday evening with
George’s first flight which was a 19 seat ‘toy’ plane. I don’t think I’ve been so excited
about a flight since the first flight I remember going on myself too many years ago. It was
both exciting and scary at the same time because George’s reaction to this flight could affect
our future traveling quite considerably.

Well, as usual, George missed the excitement through sleep! At this rate
people will start to think he does nothing but sleep! We arrived in Jersey on time after a
very uneventful flight (thankfully) and were taken swiftly out for dinner. At this point
George decided it was a good time to wake up and let the world know he existed, although not
for long, we still managed to have a good evening :smiley:.

This morning Auntie Liz took us to the pool where she works so
that George could have his first proper swimming lesson. We stopped at the fish market on the
way to the pool to pick up food for our barbecue and, no surprise, George slept the whole time.
Liz arranged for us to have some time alone in the pool, which was absolutely brilliant. It was
great to have his first experience in a swimming pool in private. Rosie and I were fully
expecting him to scream on first dip, but quite to the contrary, he seemed very contented in
the water :smiley:. Excellent!

We swam him around the pool for almost half an hour before making the
difficult decision to fully submerge him. It was at this point that the fun stopped. George
screamed his head off as soon as he resurfaced, but we’re not too sure whether that was all
down to the submersion or the fact he was getting hungry from all the exercise.

Ever since we got home, George has been sleeping with short interludes for food. I think his
Auntie Liz has properly tired him out!
