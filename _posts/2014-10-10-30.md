So recently (ok a month ago, but who's counting), I completed my
thirtieth rotation around the sun and I thought I should write something to recognise the occasion.
However, life got in the way and it's now a couple of weeks down the line and I'm only just sitting
down to write.

It seems like a fairly appropriate time to write up an update on my [Epic Quest][eq], so here it is...
