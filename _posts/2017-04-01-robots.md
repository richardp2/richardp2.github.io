I was recently listening to a [Radio 4 Podcast][r4] entitled ["The Rise of the
Robots"][ror] that got me thinking. It was a three part series that looked at
the past, present and future of robots and how they have developed in our
society both culturally and technologically. The first episode was concerned
with where the idea of the robot originated and looked at robots/automata of
the past. I was very surprised to discover the first recorded concept of a robot
was in Ancient Greece (_although I suppose I shouldn't really be surprised by
that given what the Ancient Greeks actually achieved in their time_). It was
very interesting, but what really got me thinking was episode 2.

  _This may be a bit of a long, rambling, incoherent mess of my thoughts on the
  subject of robots, technology and the future, but it may be interesting to 
  some. Hope you enjoy :wink:_

The second episode concerned robots in present society and how their current
reality has been influenced by science fiction of the last century. Every since
the first robot was introduced to the production line in 1959[^1], "experts"
have been predicting that robots would be replacing us at work and we would be
left jobless. To a certain extent, that is true. A large proportion of
mechanistic tasks in factories are now carried out by robots, but as a society
in general, we are working more. In 1959 the world population was a shade under
3 billion and we are now at around 7&frac12; billion people[^2]. In theory,
based on the proliferation of robots in industry and the massive population
growth, you would expect unemployment to be through the roof but instead UK
unemployment has gone from 2.3%[^3] to 4.7%[^4] approximately. Don't get me
wrong, that is a huge increase, especially when you consider the number of
people but it doesn't exactly show that the 'robots' are taking our jobs (_I
realise that using UK unemployment rates as the basis for my argument is a
little ridiculous, but these are merely my personal musing so I don't really
care_). In reality, technology has made a large number of jobs redundant over
the years, but there have always been different jobs to take their place. Look
at the computer industry, 100 years ago it didn't exist, now it is a massive
source of employment across the work.

On the other hand, there may come a day when 'robots' are carrying out a lot
more everyday tasks. In the construction industry, which is traditionally very
labour intensive, and often seen as being a little behind the times, there are
already significant moves towards off-site manufacturing, modular construction
etc. These techniques off load a certain amount of the labour intensive works to
a factory that, although manned, will have a large number of robots/machines
carrying out the bulk of the mechanistic, repetitive tasks, thereby reducing the
number of construction site jobs available for the workforce of the future. In
this instance though, I'm not entirely sure it's a bad thing. Especially given
the recruitment and training struggles we are currently having in the
construction industry. According to the recent [Construction Leadership
Council][clc] report [Modernise or Die][mod][^5] entrants to the construction
industry are significantly lower than leavers year on year, and woefully
inadequate to cover the labour requirements moving forward if the industry
doesn't change. If robots took over the vast majority of the work through off
site manufacture (_and clients actually chose modern methods of construction
over traditional_) then the impact of people not wanting to work in the industry
would be hugely reduced. Again though, this isn't robots taking our jobs, it's 
robots doing the jobs we (as a society) no longer want to do.

So do we have to worry about robots taking our jobs, or should we be grateful
that we are finding alternative ways of getting the less attractive jobs done?
I don't think we have to worry at this stage really. The job market has changed
significantly during the post industrial era leading to more jobs that require
human thought and reasoning over human labour. Whilst robots are gradually
infiltrating our industrial sectors, we still need people to carry out a large
number of tasks. Our level of technology is not yet capable of doing everything
that a human can do and, although technology is advancing at an incredible rate,
I think it will be a long time before we have to worry that there will be no
work for us.

In the future, and maybe only in Science Fiction, we have the potential to move
towards a very different society that isn't driven by capitalism. My train of 
thought here led me to an article by a guy called [Rick Webb][st1][^6] about the
post-scarcity economy.  This is something that is often alluded to in Science
Fiction in programmes like Star Trek[^7]. [Webb][st1] argued that our current,
'best' economic model, capitalism, is not that great (_something I
wholeheartedly agree with_) and that actually there are better models out there.
At present we seem fixated on the alternatives that have failed in the past,
without considering any alternatives that could actually work.

The concept of this (proto)post-scarcity economy is very interesting to me, and
although I feel it is a long way off for us, the age of automation and robotics
that we are entering now does seem to be the first step in that direction. Can
you imagine a society where we are not defined by the accumulation of wealth?
Well I can (_that may be because I love Star Trek, but that's another story_).
If we had managed to get our "shit together on education, health, and the
dignity of labor [sic]"[^6] then maybe would could start working towards this.
With the advent of the internet, education is starting to become easier, at
least for anyone wanting to learn new things in later life. We are also
constantly moving forward with healthcare, albeit the system is currently
strained because of the lack of financial support (_ironic really_). Human and
Workers Rights laws are also helping to move us forward with the 'dignity of
labour' so I definitely think we are moving in the right direction.

[Webb][st1] also discussed a possible route towards this post-scarcity economy
with the modification of the current (broken) welfare/benefits system. This
modification sounds a lot like the Universal Basic Income idea that has been 
touted by futurists and some economists for many years, and is currently being
given a limited trial in Finland[^8]. The premise is simple, give everyone a
basic level of income regardless of who they are, and what they do. This could
replace the various unemployment benefits, but it wouldn't be conditional on the
individual remaining unemployed because it is universal. That would
theoretically allow those who have been made redundant, or left their job for
other reasons, the freedom to find the job they really want and not just take
the first available. It could also allow someone to retrain in a different field
without the financial worries they would have under the current system. Now, I'm
not saying this would work at all, but it is an interesting concept that could
lead to the removal of the concept of money given the right conditions. Of
course it could also lead to people/companies taking advantage of the system for
their own gain, but I prefer to lean towards the more optimistic prospects.

Maybe by the 24th Century we will live in a society like that in Star Trek that
strives only for "self improvement and cultural enrichment"[^6], but then again,
maybe not. The only thing that is certain is that things need to change because
the rise of the robots is here and we need to understand how that is going to
affect us. As we continue on in the technological age, maybe, just maybe, we can
use the coming changes to bring our world together, to reduce our need for 
material wealth and to start to fix the mess we have made of our world over the
last century or so. I'd like to think it's possible, however far fetched it 
seems at the moment.

If you have any interest in robots/robotics, then I would highly recommend
checking out the [series at Radio 4][ror]. The episodes are only a &frac12;hour
each. Then, if that leads you down the rabbit hole like it did for me, then I
can also thoroughly recommend Rick Webb's [article][st1] as well.
