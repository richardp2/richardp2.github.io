It has now been 3 months since I started my Mandarin Language Challenge so it's time for another update. This month has been very slow going and I have achieved pretty much nothing. I started the month with the intention of reviewing all the Pimsleur lesson I had learned so far and reciting the conversations from each lesson as SoundCloud items. However, it wasn't until 15 November that I uploaded the first two lessons, and then I haven't continued since. I have therefore decided to pretend that November didn't happen and try to continue from where I left off at the end of October with the same goals etc. carrying forward to December.

For those that are interested, here is the only audio clip I have uploaded in the last month:
