So my 4 months are up and unfortunately, the last 2 months have been a bit useless for various
reasons, so needless to say I haven't really managed to achieve my goal. Over the last month I have
probably only spent about 10 hours learning Mandarin, and the bulk of that was probably reviewing
characters on [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com). I have still not yet completed all 30 lessons from
[Pimsleurs](http://www.pimsleur.com/Learn-Mandarin-Chinese) Mandarin 1 so that is still on my todo
list.

I have improved by reading comprehension and my speaking a little, but I don't think I would be able
to hold a 5 minute conversation yet. Ah well. I have enjoyed it and so I will continue to plod on at
my previous pace and see how it goes. Even though I haven't achieved what I set out to, I still
think it was a worthwhile experiment and I will continue to set targets for future learning in the
hope that some day I do manage to learn Mandarin to a conversational level. With that in mind, here
are my goals for 2013:
	
  * Finish [Pimsleurs](http://www.pimsleur.com/Learn-Mandarin-Chinese) Mandarin 1 (yes it's still here, I've got to do it someday!);
  * Increase my character knowledge to 1,500 characters;
  * Make use of [Verbling](http://www.verbling.com/) (a new service for having short conversations with native speakers) to improve my spoken Mandarin.

So nothing over the top, but hopefully they're achievable.
