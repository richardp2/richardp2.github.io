(_This post has been inspired by Steve Kamb at [Nerd Fitness][eq]_)

I recently read an article on [Nerd Fitness][eq] where Steve Kamb had set out his goals for
"levelling up" his life. He used the metaphor of Role Playing Games to make the concept manageable
and put together a list of challenges or quests that could be completed to advance from one level to
the next. He then decided that each quest would be worth 20% experience towards the next level,
there would also be Master Quests that equated to 100% experience, and this became his 'Epic Quest
of Awesome'. I thought this was a pretty good idea, so using the same concept, I have come up with
my own Epic Quest. It's no different to a bucket list that many people have, but it just sounds
cooler :wink:.

I've been very lucky over the last few years so I've already done a lot of the things I would have
added to this list. So here it is. Let me know what you think.
