(_This post has been inspired by Steve Kamb at [Nerd Fitness](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/epic-quest/)_)

I recently read an article on [Nerd Fitness](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/epic-quest/) where
Steve Kamb had set out his goals for "levelling up" his life. He used the metaphor of Role Playing
Games to make the concept manageable and put together a list of challenges or quests that could be
completed to advance from one level to the next. He then decided that each quest would be worth 20%
experience towards the next level, there would also be Master Quests that equated to 100% experience,
and this became his 'Epic Quest of Awesome'. I thought this was a pretty good idea, so using the
same concept, I have come up with my own Epic Quest. It's no different to a bucket list that many
people have, but it just sounds cooler ;-).

I've been very lucky over the last few years so I've already done a lot of the things I would have
added to this list. So here it is. Let me know what you think.
