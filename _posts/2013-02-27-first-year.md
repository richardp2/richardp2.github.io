George is now a year old so I thought it might be time for a bit of reflection on how the first year
has gone :smiley:. For Rosie & I, it has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride, but I think we've been
very lucky. George has generally been good as gold since the day he was born. Don't get me wrong, he
cries, screams and tests the boundaries just like any other kid, but I think we may have had things
a little easier than most. Most of the time he seems to be contented and happy, but he is definitely
learning the art of crying for attention! We'll have to keep that one in check I think. George also
seems to be developing physically very fast. Granted he is short (but who does that surprise with
Rosie & I for parents!!) but he went from being a generally stationary baby to walking in no time at
all! It's brilliant to see the progression and I am really enjoying the fact he is so mobile most of
the time, although sometimes it would be nice if he would stay put for longer than 1 second! Here is
a list of the milestones he has reached in his first 12 months.

### Milestones
	
  * 07 February 2012 - George was born :grinning: at 13:47 weighing 3.48kg (7lb 11oz)
  * 09 - 12 April 2012 - First holiday (Cornwall)
  * 08 May 2012 - First laughed
  * 25 May 2012 - First night camping (Portcullis Camp)
  * 01 June 2012 - First flight (to Jersey)
  * 09 June 2012 - First sat up
  * July 2012 - First walked with help
  * 18 July 2012 - First sat unaided

We are still really enjoying being parents, even with the occasional sleepless night, public temper
tantrum etc. I am extremely glad I made the decision to move to my [new job][job] because it has
meant I have been able to spend a lot more time with George than I would have done otherwise. It's
been a great year and I'm thoroughly looking forward to what this year will bring :grinning:.
