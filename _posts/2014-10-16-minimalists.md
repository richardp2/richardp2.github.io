[![The Minimalists & Us][thm]][img]{: .alignright }
Last night, Rosie and I went out, just the two of us, for an evening in Cardiff. It is the first
time we have been out for a while, and we went to a book tour in a lovely, cosy little place called
the Juno Lounge (can highly recommend the place for a nice evening by the way). This particular book
tour was being carried out by a couple of American guys who call themselves [The Minimalists][mnml].
Rosie & I have been reading the essays they publish on their [website][mnml] for a couple of years
now and thought it would be cool to meet them.

### Who Are The Minimalists?

They are a couple of guys who spent their early 20's climbing the corporate ladder chasing the
American Dream, before actually realising that they were both fairly unhappy and the American Dream
was not all it's cracked up to be. Neither of them work in the corporate world anymore. They instead
write, mentor and speak for a living. There is a much better introduction on [their website][abt] 
and I highly recommend you check it out if you are even vaguely interested. The essays they publish
are inspired as well as being useful.

Having now met them, they seem to be very happy, down-to-earth, genuine people who seem to have
landed upon 'the secret' to their happiness.

### The Tour

The Minimalists have recently published a new book, [Everything That Remains][etr], and that was the
purpose of their brief visit to Cardiff last night. When the book was completed, they made the
decision to carry out a [huge 100 city tour][tour] to celebrate it and to give people a more
personal introduction to them and their story. The event was free and we both found it to be a
very enjoyable evening. The talk was very interesting and informative, and it was great to talk to 
the guys after the event.

If you have any interest in minimalism or just simplifying your life, then I would highly recommend
you check out the [website][mnml], read one of their [books][bks], or if you're available for any of
the remaining [tour] dates you should definitely go!
